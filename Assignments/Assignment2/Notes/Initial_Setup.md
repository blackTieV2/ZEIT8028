To find out the exact version of Windows and its release number from a memory capture using Volatility, follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up Your Environment
First, make sure you are in the directory where Volatility's `vol.py` script is located.

### 2. Identify the Profile
You need to identify the correct Volatility profile to use for your memory capture. This profile will correspond to the specific Windows version and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).

Use the following command:

```bash
python2 vol.py -f ~/8028HDD/'Assessment 2'/Evidence/memory/memory.raw imageinfo
```

This will analyze the memory dump and provide suggested profiles. Look for the `Suggested Profile(s)` output.

### 3. Get the Exact Windows Version
Once you have the suggested profiles, you can dig deeper into the specific Windows version by using the `kdbgscan` or `verinfo` plugin.

```python
Suggested Profile(s) : Win10x64_17134, Win10x64_14393, Win10x64_10586, Win10x64_16299, Win2016x64_14393, Win10x64_17763, Win10x64_15063 (Instantiated with Win10x64_15063)
```
#### Using `verinfo`
This plugin provides a straightforward way to obtain the version information:

```bash
python2 vol.py -f ~/8028HDD/'Assessment 2'/Evidence/memory/memory.raw --profile=Win10x64_17763 verinfo
```

The `verinfo` plugin will directly provide you with the version information, including the major, minor, and build numbers.

### 4. Interpret the Results
After running `verinfo` examine the output:

- **Major and Minor Version:** This will indicate the main version of Windows (e.g., 6.1 corresponds to Windows 7).
- **Build Number:** This gives the specific build, which can be mapped to a specific update or service pack.
- **Service Pack:** Identifies the service pack level if applicable.

You can cross-reference the build number with Microsoft's official documentation or use online resources to match it to the specific release number of Windows.

```bash
\SystemRoot\System32\smss.exe
  File version    : 10.0.17763.1
  Product version : 10.0.17763.1
  Flags           : 
  OS              : Windows NT
  File Type       : Application
  File Date       : 
  CompanyName : Microsoft Corporation
  FileDescription : Windows Session Manager
  FileVersion : 10.0.17763.1 (WinBuild.160101.0800)
  InternalName : smss.exe
  LegalCopyright : \xa9 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
  OriginalFilename : smss.exe
  ProductName : Microsoft\xae Windows\xae Operating System
  ProductVersion : 10.0.17763.1
```

This will provide you with detailed information about the Windows version and its release number.

### Notes
- Ensure you have Python 2 installed, as Volatility 2.x relies on it.
- The exact path to your memory dump file and Volatility might differ, so adjust commands accordingly.

By following these steps, you should be able to determine the exact version of Windows and its release number from your memory capture.
