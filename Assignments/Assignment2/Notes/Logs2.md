Given the detailed information you have, there are several key areas in the logs where you should be able to find additional evidence to corroborate and further understand the scope of the breach. Here's what you should look for in the logs:

### 1. **Initial Compromise Evidence:**
   - **Web Activity Logs:** Look for entries related to the URL `https://uploadfiles.io/hr4z39kn`. This could be found in web browser logs (e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome), firewall logs, or proxy logs. These logs should show the exact time the file was downloaded and the source IP address.
   - **File System Events:** Look for file creation events around the timestamp `17/8/2019 5:42:15 AM` when `resume.doc.exe` was created. The logs should show the file being written to the `Downloads` folder and potentially being executed shortly thereafter.

### 2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - **PowerShell Logs (Event ID 4104):** You've already filtered these logs. Look for any instances of commands that involve `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Invoke-Expression`, or any Base64 encoded commands. These should match the PowerShell scripts mentioned (`WriteRemoteEncoded.ps1`, `ElevateExecute.ps1`, etc.).
   - **Script Block Logging:** Look for detailed PowerShell script content that matches the activities described, such as downloading from Pastebin URLs and writing files to the Temp directory.

### 3. **Network Communication:**
   - **Network Connection Logs:** Look for logs indicating connections to the C2 server at `69.50.64.20`. This includes any outbound connections on port 443 (HTTPS). If available, firewall or IDS/IPS logs may show more details on the traffic to this IP.
   - **DNS Queries:** Search for DNS resolution queries related to `pastebin.com` or any other suspicious domains that were accessed during the attack. These could provide additional context on the attackerâ€™s infrastructure.
   - **TCP Streams:** Review all captured TCP streams in Wireshark or similar tools that show data transferred between the compromised machine and `69.50.64.20`. This will help verify the commands executed remotely and any data that may have been exfiltrated.

### 4. **Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - **Registry Logs:** Look for registry changes, particularly in the path `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Folder\shell\open\command`. This should include the modifications made by `ElevateExecute.ps1` to establish persistence.
   - **Service Creation Logs:** Search for entries in the Windows Event Logs (Event ID 7045) that indicate a new service was created, particularly the "ScvHost" service. This will show when and how `scvhost.exe` was set up to run on system startup.
   - **Startup Programs:** Check logs related to startup programs and services to identify if `scvhost.exe` was registered to start automatically.

### 5. **Credential Dumping:**
   - **Process Creation Logs:** Look for entries related to the execution of `procdump64.exe`, particularly any process creation logs (Event ID 4688) that show `procdump64.exe` being used to create the `lsass.dmp` file. This could also include details about who executed the process and when.
   - **File Access Logs:** If available, check for logs showing access to `lsass.exe` and the subsequent creation of `lsass.dmp`. This file should have been created in the Temp directory, and the logs might show any access or modification times.
   - **Security Logs (Event ID 4656):** Search for logs that indicate access to sensitive processes or objects, particularly any entries showing `procdump64.exe` acquiring a handle to `lsass.exe`.

### 6. **User Activity:**
   - **User Account Logs:** Investigate logs that show user "Craig" and any commands or actions performed under this account. This could include anything from command history to specific interactions with the system (e.g., command prompt activity, downloads).
   - **Login and Logout Events:** Check for any unusual login activity, particularly around the time `Craig` executed `procdump64.exe` and downloaded `Procdump.zip`. This can help identify if this account was compromised or if the user was tricked into performing these actions.

### 7. **Malicious Executables and Modules:**
   - **File Hash Verification:** Correlate the downloaded and executed files (`scvhost.exe`, `plink.exe`, etc.) with known malicious hashes from threat intelligence databases like VirusTotal. This can confirm the identity and purpose of these files.
   - **Module Loading Logs:** Check the logs for any suspicious modules loaded by `scvhost.exe`, such as `ws2_32.dll`, which is used for network communication. This can indicate what actions the malware was performing on the system.

### 8. **Exfiltration and Data Theft:**
   - **Data Transfer Logs:** Look for large outbound data transfers or unusual spikes in network traffic, which could indicate data exfiltration, especially during the time `plink.exe` or other network-related tools were active.
   - **SSH Tunnel Activity:** If `plink.exe` was used for SSH tunneling, there might be logs or indicators in the network traffic showing SSH connections being established, possibly through non-standard ports.

### Conclusion

By focusing on these specific log entries and types of evidence, you should be able to build a comprehensive timeline and understanding of the breach. Each piece of evidence will help confirm the methods used by the attacker, the extent of the compromise, and the actions taken on the compromised system. This detailed analysis is crucial for effective remediation and for ensuring similar incidents do not recur.
