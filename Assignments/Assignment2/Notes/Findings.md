

Based on the directory and the files listed in the folder `/img_disk.raw/vol_vol7/Users/Alan/AppData/Local/Microsoft/OneDrive/18.143.0717.0002/`, it appears that this directory contains several executable and dynamic link library (DLL) files, which are not typically found in a user's OneDrive directory. This is suspicious and warrants further investigation.

### Suspicious Files in the Directory:

1. **`CollectSyncLogs.bat`**:
   - **Type**: Batch file (`.bat`)
   - **Suspicious Activity**: Batch files can execute commands that modify the system, delete or copy files, or run other executables. This could be a script used for logging purposes, or it could be used maliciously.

2. **`FileCoAuth.exe`**:
   - **Type**: Executable file (`.exe`)
   - **Suspicious Activity**: Executable files can be used to run programs or scripts. If this executable is not part of a legitimate OneDrive operation, it might be a malicious file introduced by an attacker.

3. **Various DLL files**:
   - **`FileSyncClient.dll`, `FileSyncShell.dll`, `FileSyncViews.dll`, `ipcfile.dll`, `ipcsecproc.dll`, `libeay32.dll`, `msipc.dll`, `Qt5Widgets.dll`**:
   - **Type**: Dynamic Link Library files (`.dll`)
   - **Suspicious Activity**: DLL files are used by executables to perform functions. Malicious DLLs can be used in attacks such as DLL hijacking or side-loading, where an attacker places a malicious DLL in a location where it will be loaded by a legitimate program.

4. **`TestSharePage.html`**:
   - **Type**: HTML file
   - **Suspicious Activity**: HTML files can be used for phishing or redirecting users to malicious websites. The context in which this file was created and used is critical to understanding its purpose.

5. **`ThirdPartyNotices.txt`**:
   - **Type**: Text file
   - **Suspicious Activity**: Typically, `.txt` files are less likely to be malicious on their own but could be part of a larger malicious package or operation. This file might just contain third-party notices as the name suggests, but it should still be reviewed.

### Analysis and Next Steps:
1. **Hash Analysis**: The SHA-256 and MD5 hashes provided should be checked against known malware databases like VirusTotal to determine if these files are known to be malicious.

2. **Dynamic and Static Analysis**:
   - Analyze the batch file (`CollectSyncLogs.bat`) for commands that might be executed.
   - The executable files (`FileCoAuth.exe` and DLLs) should be dynamically and statically analyzed to understand their behavior. You can use tools like Ghidra, IDA Pro, or any debugger to reverse engineer them.
   - The HTML file (`TestSharePage.html`) should be opened and reviewed to see if it contains any suspicious content, such as phishing links or embedded malicious scripts.

3. **Cross-reference**: Review the creation and modification timestamps to see if these files correspond to any known suspicious activity on the machine. Check system logs for any execution of these files.

4. **Network Connections**: If any of these executables were run, investigate whether they established any network connections that could indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control activity.

These files should be treated with caution as they are located in a directory where you wouldn't typically expect to find such executables and scripts. This anomaly suggests that the files might have been placed there as part of a compromise.

### Analysis of `CollectSyncLogs.bat`

The `CollectSyncLogs.bat` script is designed to gather various logs and system information related to the OneDrive client, compress them into a `.cab` file, and potentially send the file via email. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

#### **Key Functions:**
1. **Environment Setup:**
   - The script sets up environment variables like `OUTPUTDIR` (defaulting to the user's Desktop) and `CABOUTPUT`, which is the name of the `.cab` file that will be created.
   - It checks for command-line arguments to customize behavior, such as setting a custom output directory or disabling the collection of a process dump of `OneDrive.exe`.

2. **Client Path Discovery:**
   - The script identifies the path where OneDrive client logs are stored by checking the `LOCALAPPDATA` environment variable. If this path doesnâ€™t exist, the script exits with an error message.

3. **Log Collection:**
   - The script creates a working directory within the OneDrive client path and proceeds to collect various logs, including:
     - Event logs (using the `SaveApplicationEventLogs.wsf` script).
     - Tasklist and system information (`tasklist /v` and `systeminfo`).
     - Running services (`net start`).
     - OneDrive logs and settings.
     - Registry keys related to OneDrive and Windows Explorer's Shell Icon Overlay Identifiers, Run, and RunOnce keys.

4. **CAB File Creation:**
   - Once the logs are collected, the script compresses them into a `.cab` file using the `MakeCab` command.
   - The `.cab` file is then moved to the specified output directory, which defaults to the user's Desktop unless otherwise specified.

5. **Email Option:**
   - If the `/SendMail` option is provided, the script attempts to send an email with the `.cab` file's path using the `mailto` command. The email is intended to be sent to `wldrxireport@microsoft.com`.

#### **Suspicious or Malicious Indicators:**
- **Automated Log Collection and Exfiltration:** While this script could be legitimate (e.g., for troubleshooting OneDrive issues), it can also be misused by attackers to collect detailed information about the system, including running processes, services, registry keys, and logs, and then exfiltrate this information via email.
- **Email Functionality:** The script's capability to send the `.cab` file via email can be leveraged by an attacker to exfiltrate collected data without alerting the user.

#### **Next Steps:**
1. **Examine Execution Logs:** Investigate if and when this script was executed on the system. This can be done by checking the event logs and other execution traces (e.g., Prefetch files, Scheduled Tasks).
2. **Cross-Reference with Network Logs:** Check network logs to see if any emails or other network traffic corresponds to the script's behavior, particularly around the time when the script might have been run.
3. **Review the Contents of the `.cab` Files:** If the `.cab` files generated by this script are present, review their contents to see what data was collected and whether it includes sensitive information.

This script has the potential to be used for data collection and exfiltration, making it a key item of interest in your forensic investigation.
