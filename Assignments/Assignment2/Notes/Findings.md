2. **Application Path**: `\VOLUME{01d5382712c52860-b2135219}\USERS\ALAN\DOWNLOADS\RESUME.DOC.EXE`
3. **Run Count**: `1` (This indicates the file was executed once.)
4. **File Created Date/Time**: `17/8/2019 5:42:15 AM`
5. **Last Run Date/Time**: `17/8/2019 5:41:59 AM`
6. **File Hash**: `AA8459C3`
7. **Volume Name**: `\VOLUME{01d5382712c52860-b2135219}`
8. **Volume Created Date/Time**: `11/7/2019 8:27:34 PM`
9. **File Location**: `.\Attachments\RESUME.DOC.EXE` and `.\Attachments\RESUME.DOC (1).EXE`
10. **Source**: `disk.raw - Partition 4 (Microsoft NTFS, 59.4 GB)`

### Analysis:

1. **File Execution**:
   - **Created Date/Time vs. Last Run Date/Time**: The creation and last run timestamps are almost identical (`17/8/2019 5:42:15 AM` for creation and `5:41:59 AM` for last run). This suggests that `RESUME.DOC.EXE` was executed immediately after being created or downloaded.
   - **Run Count**: The `Run Count` is `1`, confirming that the file was executed at least once.

2. **File Location and Source**:
   - **Application Path**: The file was located in the user's `Downloads` folder, which is typical for files downloaded from the internet.
   - **Prefetch File**: The existence of a prefetch file (`RESUME.DOC.EXE-AA8459C3.pf`) in the `Windows\Prefetch` directory confirms that the file was executed on the system. The prefetch file helps track the application execution details.
   - **Source**: The source is `disk.raw - Partition 4`, indicating that the evidence was extracted from this partition.

3. **Volume Information**:
   - **Volume Name**: `\VOLUME{01d5382712c52860-b2135219}`
   - **Volume Created Date/Time**: `11/7/2019 8:27:34 PM`. This timestamp tells you when the volume (or more specifically, the partition) was created, which might help correlate with other system events, like OS installation or drive reformatting.

4. **File Hash**:
   - **Hash (AA8459C3)**: This is the hash of the `RESUME.DOC.EXE` file. You can use this to cross-reference against known malicious file hashes in databases like VirusTotal.

5. **File Duplication**:
   - **Duplicate Entries**: The file appears to have two associated locations, `.\Attachments\RESUME.DOC.EXE` and `.\Attachments\RESUME.DOC (1).EXE`. This could indicate the file was duplicated or renamed, possibly by the user or as part of the malicious activity.
