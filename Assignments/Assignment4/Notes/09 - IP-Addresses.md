To build on the log you've shared, let's add further insights from the packet captures, IP reputation analysis, and our examination of **TLS traffic**.

### **Consolidated Log Record for IP 185.47.40.36 (Based on AlienVault and Forensic Reports)**

#### **Summary**:
- **IP Address**: 185.47.40.36

---

#### **1. Network and Host Activity**:
- **Date of Activity**: 2019-10-14, observed during multiple TLS sessions from **04:25:01 to 04:27:26 UTC**.
- **Associated Domains**:
  - filebin.net
  - www.filebin.net
  - dev.filebin.net
- **Antivirus Detections**:
  - Trojans: Win32:TrojanX-gen, Win64:DropperX-gen, MSIL/AntiDbg.VB, Sabsik.FT.A, CryptInject.BQ, etc.

##### **Network Traffic Analysis**:
- **Total Packets Captured**: 4917 packets, 10 specifically tied to **IP 185.47.40.36**.
- **Significant Packets**: `70703`, `70704`, `70745`, `70808`, `81081`.
- **TLS Communication**:
  - Encrypted data between **185.47.40.36** and **10.2.0.10**, using **ECDHE-RSA-AES-256-GCM-SHA384** encryption.
  - Session termination via **TLS Encrypted Alerts** suggests potential malicious intent to cover up communication.
  
---

#### **2. Malware Distribution and Threat Behavior**:
- **Linked Domains**:
  - `filebin.net` and subdomains like `netdata.filebin.net`, associated with malware distribution and C2 traffic.
  
- **Historical Malicious Activity**:
  - Phishing, ransomware, and keylogger distribution.
  - Previous pulses tied to **Emotet**, **Magniber**, and other malware families.

##### **Artifact Analysis**:
- **Artifact: Minesweeperz.exe** (Downloaded from filebin.net):
  - Malware flagged across multiple AV engines, suspected to be involved in data exfiltration or as part of C2 operations.
  
- **Forensic Timeline Analysis**:
  - **Process Creation Timestamps** suggest a link between the download of **Minesweeperz.exe** and suspicious process launches on the host machine around 04:25:00 UTC. Timeline correlation is recommended.
  - Use the following filter for **Windows Event Logs** in Magnet AXIOM:
  ```bash
  "Process Creation" && timestamp == "14/10/2019 04:25:00" to "14/10/2019 04:45:00"
  ```

---

#### **3. IP Reputation and Forensic Analysis**:
- **VirusTotal**:
  - **1/94 vendors** flagged the IP, linked to phishing and email spam, but overall low confidence in recent activity.

- **AbuseIPDB**:
  - Historical phishing campaigns, last reported by **Mudguts** in 2022, involving malicious URLs.

- **Forensic Observations**:
  - **Encrypted Traffic**: Rapid exchange of TLSv1.2 encrypted data suggests potential C2 activity.
  - **TLS Certificate**: Issued by **Let's Encrypt** for `filebin.net`, which, while commonly legitimate, can be exploited by attackers for secure malicious communications.

---

#### **4. Recommendations and Next Steps**:

1. **Host Investigation**:
   - Correlate the **TLS traffic** timestamps (04:25:01 - 04:27:26) with process creation logs or registry changes on the host (`10.2.0.10`).
   - Check for persistence mechanisms (e.g., scheduled tasks, registry modifications).

2. **DNS Log Review**:
   - Examine DNS queries related to `185.47.40.36` and `filebin.net` to identify additional indicators of compromise.

3. **Network Action**:
   - **Block traffic** to and from IP **185.47.40.36** and monitor for further attempts to connect to similar malicious domains.

4. **Decryption and Monitoring**:
   - Attempt to decrypt **TLS traffic** if keys are available to determine the nature of exchanged data.
   - **Monitor persistence** on the host machine to identify any ongoing threat activity.

By correlating the network activity, malicious artifacts, and historical reports, this log suggests that **IP 185.47.40.36** was involved in malware distribution and potential C2 operations. Investigation should focus on host-based analysis, timeline correlation, and network traffic blocking.
### **Next Steps**:
- **Host Review**: Focus on the system `10.2.0.10` during the observed traffic windows. Any malicious processes tied to the **TLS sessions** will help clarify the scope of the breach.
- **Expanded Network Analysis**: Look for additional outbound communications or lateral movement linked to other internal systems.

Here are the log records for the **three IP addresses** involved in the investigation based on their detection and analysis:

### **Log Record for IP Address: 52.229.207.60**

#### **Summary:**
- **IP Address**: 52.229.207.60
- **Owner**: Microsoft Corporation
- **ISP**: Microsoft Corporation (MSN-AS-BLOCK)
- **Location**: Hong Kong
- **Confidence of Abuse**: 0% (whitelisted, no abuse reports)
  
#### **Analysis:**
- This IP address is associated with **Microsoft Corporation's services** and shows no signs of malicious activity according to both **VirusTotal** and **AbuseIPDB** reports. The **zero detections** suggest that this IP is likely part of legitimate cloud hosting infrastructure (e.g., **Azure** or other Microsoft services).
  
- **Relevance**: Since it's a Microsoft-owned IP, it's possible that communication with this IP was part of standard system operations, updates, or cloud service interactions, rather than a direct indicator of compromise.

### **Log Record for IP Address: 117.18.232.240**

#### **Summary:**
- **IP Address**: 117.18.232.240
- **Owner**: EdgeCast Networks (Content Delivery Network)
- **ISP**: EdgeCast Networks (AS15133)
- **Location**: United States (Thousand Oaks, California)
- **Confidence of Abuse**: 0% (minimal abuse reports, considered **whitelisted**)
- **Abuse Reports**: Four reports between March 2021 and March 2023, linked to DDoS attacks and suspicious traffic.
  
#### **Analysis:**
- **Historical Reports**: In the past, this IP has been associated with **DDoS attacks** and **outbound requests** containing suspicious patterns. The most recent report was from **nine months ago**.
  
- **Relevance**: While the current IP is largely whitelisted, the previous history of attacks raises some concerns about its past use for malicious activities. This IP may have been involved in **data exfiltration** or **C2 (Command and Control)** activity depending on what services were active during the time Minesweeperz.exe was running.

### **Log Record for IP Address: 172.217.167.67**

#### **Summary:**
- **IP Address**: 172.217.167.67
- **Owner**: Google LLC
- **ISP**: Google LLC (AS15169)
- **Location**: Sydney, New South Wales, Australia
- **Confidence of Abuse**: 0% (minimal abuse, detected by only one AV tool)
  
#### **Analysis:**
- **Previous Activity**: This IP is tied to Google's services and, in the past, was linked to **phishing** and **web spam** (with one report from one year ago). Although the IP is largely considered **clean**, any suspicious activity would be tied to specific services running under Google infrastructure (like **Google Cloud**).
  
- **Relevance**: Similar to the first IP, this address likely belongs to **Google's cloud services**. However, given the **phishing history** of this IP, itâ€™s worth investigating further to see if any suspicious data flows occurred during the time Minesweeperz.exe ran.

---

### Conclusion:
These IP addresses are part of legitimate infrastructure (Microsoft and Google). However, the **117.18.232.240** IP shows some past malicious activity, and should be analyzed further in the context of possible **C2 traffic** or data transfers initiated by Minesweeperz.exe. For the next steps, logs and further traffic analysis will help solidify whether any of these IPs were used for malicious purposes.

Now that you have the log records, let me know if you want to proceed with analyzing **Victim 2's SRUM logs and Event logs** for process creation.
