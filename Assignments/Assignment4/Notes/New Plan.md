As the lead investigator, here’s what I need you to do immediately to drive the investigation forward and provide a complete report to the client:

### **Priority Actions**:

1. **Memory Dump Analysis**:
   - Use **Volatility** to analyze the memory dump (`victim_02.memory.raw`) more thoroughly. 
   - Run the following commands:
     - **pslist**: Get a full list of processes running during the time of infection.
     - **dlllist**: Check for suspicious DLL injections or unexpected modules in critical processes like **explorer.exe** or **svchost.exe**.
     - **cmdline**: Extract command-line arguments from processes to see if any PowerShell commands were run after the malware was executed.
     - **malfind**: Search for any suspicious or hidden processes related to the malware or persistence.

   **Next Steps for You**:
   - Provide me with the output of **pslist**, **dlllist**, and **malfind**. This will help me identify any malicious processes or further analyze injected code.

2. **Browser and Timeline Artifacts**:
   - **Edge Cache & Browser History**: Analyze the full cache and browsing history of **Craig's** account. Focus on identifying other potentially malicious sites or phishing links beyond the Minesweeper-related domains.
   - **PowerShell Event Logs**: Correlate PowerShell executions with the browser history around the time of the malware download (4:25 AM - 4:46 AM). Check the **event logs** to confirm what commands were executed.

   **Next Steps for You**:
   - Extract the **PowerShell event logs** and provide them for review, along with the detailed **browser cache** for suspicious URLs.

3. **Registry Forensics**:
   - We need to check for **persistence**. Focus on the following:
     - **Run keys**: Examine keys in `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` and `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.
     - **Scheduled Tasks**: Look for suspicious tasks in the Windows Task Scheduler that might allow the malware to persist after reboots.
     - **Service Keys**: Investigate any unusual services that may have been created by the malware.

   **Next Steps for You**:
   - Run a full **registry scan** for these entries and report any findings.

4. **Network Forensics**:
   - Deep dive into the **SRUM network usage** logs and the **network packet captures** from the compromised machine:
     - **Identify outgoing connections**: Confirm what data was sent to the C2 server (**185.47.40.36**) and whether any other malicious IPs or domains were contacted.
     - **Decrypt TLS traffic** (if possible) to determine what kind of information was being transmitted.

   **Next Steps for You**:
   - Provide **SRUM network usage logs** and help decrypt the **TLS traffic** to analyze the data transferred during the infection.

5. **Correlate Prefetch and Event Logs**:
   - Prefetch files indicate that the malware was executed several times. Correlate the prefetch data with the **Windows Event Logs** and **timeline data** to establish a sequence of events—this will give us the full picture of what actions were taken on the system.

   **Next Steps for You**:
   - Review the **Event Logs** and correlate them with the **Prefetch file executions** to identify the exact sequence of malware execution, PowerShell scripts, and any user interaction.

### **For the Next 24 Hours**:

1. **Start with Memory and Browser Artifacts**: Begin the detailed analysis of the memory dump and extract PowerShell and browser-related artifacts for correlation.
2. **Extract Registry Persistence Artifacts**: Investigate the registry for persistence mechanisms (Run keys, Scheduled Tasks).
3. **Network Analysis**: Gather network logs and packet captures, focusing on outbound traffic and potential data exfiltration.
4. **Correlate All Data**: Provide a full sequence of events by matching Prefetch files, PowerShell executions, and network traffic.

Once you have gathered and shared the outputs, I’ll help you analyze the findings to provide the most robust report possible for the client, answering **how the computers were compromised**, **the extent of the compromise**, and **what was stolen** with irrefutable proof.

Let’s proceed step by step. Get back to me with the outputs and findings as soon as possible.
