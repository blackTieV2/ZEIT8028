Certainly! Let's proceed to fill in the missing information needed to form a complete attack chain. Our objective is to gather irrefutable evidence by filling the gaps identified in the previous report.

## **Next Steps to Fill in the Missing Information**

### **1. Detailed Logs of Lateral Movement to Victim 2**

**Objective:** Find evidence of how the attacker moved from Victim 1 to Victim 2, specifically focusing on the use of PsExec and any file transfers or commands executed on Victim 2 originating from Victim 1.

---

### **A. Analyze Network Traffic for SMB Connections**

**Tool:** Wireshark

**Actions:**

1. **Identify IP Addresses:**

   - Determine the IP addresses of Victim 1 and Victim 2 from the network captures or system configurations.
     - Let's assume:
       - **Victim 1 IP:** `10.0.0.1`
       - **Victim 2 IP:** `10.0.0.2`

2. **Load PCAP File into Wireshark:**

   - Open Wireshark.
   - Load the provided network packet capture (`traffic.pcap`).

3. **Apply SMB Filter Between Victim 1 and Victim 2:**

   - Use the following Wireshark display filter:

     ```
     (ip.src == 10.0.0.1 && ip.dst == 10.0.0.2) && (tcp.port == 445 || tcp.port == 139)
     ```

     - This filters SMB traffic (`TCP port 445` and `139`) from Victim 1 to Victim 2.

4. **Examine SMB Traffic for PsExec Activity:**

   - **Look for File Transfers:**

     - Search for any file transfer operations, especially involving `PSEXESVC.exe`.
     - Go to **File** → **Export Objects** → **SMB...** to see if any files were transferred.

   - **Identify Named Pipe Usage:**

     - PsExec uses named pipes for communication. Look for connections to `\pipe\psexesvc`.

     - Use the filter:

       ```
       smb.pipe == "\PSEXESVC"
       ```

5. **Check for Service Installation:**

   - PsExec installs a service on the remote machine. Look for SMB packets indicating service creation.

   - Look for SMB transactions involving:

     - `NT CREATE ANDX Request`
     - `NT CREATE ANDX Response`

   - Examine any `Remote Service Control Manager` operations.

**Please execute these steps and report back with your findings, including any evidence of:**

- File transfers of `PSEXESVC.exe` or other executables from Victim 1 to Victim 2.
- Named pipe communications related to PsExec.
- Service installation or remote command execution events.

### **B. Examine Event Logs for Remote Execution**

**Tool:** AXIOM Examine or Autopsy (since we have the disk images loaded)

**Actions:**

1. **Load Windows Event Logs:**

   - In AXIOM Examine or Autopsy, navigate to the Windows Event Logs from Victim 2's disk image.

2. **Filter Security Event Logs:**

   - Focus on Event IDs related to remote logins and service installations.
   - Relevant Event IDs include:
     - **Event ID 4624:** Successful account logon.
     - **Event ID 4672:** Special privileges assigned to new logon.
     - **Event ID 7045:** A service was installed on the system.

3. **Filter for Timeframe Around Suspected Compromise:**

   - Narrow down events to the timeframe when the lateral movement likely occurred (e.g., October 14, 2019, between 04:30 AM and 05:00 AM).

4. **Look for Remote Logon Events:**

   - Identify any logon events with `Logon Type 3` (Network logon) originating from Victim 1's IP address.

5. **Check for Service Installation:**

   - Look for **Event ID 7045** indicating the installation of `PSEXESVC` service.

6. **Report Back:**

   - Provide details of any relevant events, including timestamps, user accounts used, and source IP addresses.

### **C. Analyze Prefetch Files on Victim 2**

**Tool:** AXIOM Examine or Autopsy

**Actions:**

1. **Locate Prefetch Files:**

   - Navigate to the `Windows\Prefetch` directory in Victim 2's disk image.

2. **Look for Evidence of `PSEXESVC.exe` Execution:**

   - Identify any prefetch files named `PSEXESVC.EXE-*.pf` or related to `P.exe`.

3. **Examine Execution Times:**

   - Note the timestamps of when these executables were run on Victim 2.

4. **Correlate with Network Activity:**

   - Cross-reference these times with the SMB traffic and event logs to establish a timeline.

5. **Report Back:**

   - Provide details of the prefetch files found, including names, execution counts, and timestamps.

---

### **D. Examine Scheduled Tasks and Services on Victim 2**

**Tool:** AXIOM Examine or Autopsy

**Actions:**

1. **Check for New Services:**

   - In the registry files from Victim 2, navigate to:

     ```
     HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
     ```

   - Look for entries related to `PSEXESVC` or other suspicious services.

2. **Review Scheduled Tasks:**

   - Examine the contents of:

     ```
     C:\Windows\System32\Tasks
     ```

   - Look for any tasks that were created around the time of the compromise.

3. **Report Back:**

   - Document any findings related to new services or scheduled tasks, including names, execution paths, and creation times.

---

### **E. Analyze File System for Malware Samples on Victim 2**

**Tool:** AXIOM Examine or Autopsy

**Actions:**

1. **Search for `Minesweeperz.exe`:**

   - Perform a file search for `Minesweeperz.exe` or similarly named files on Victim 2's disk image.

2. **Check Recycle Bin and Temporary Folders:**

   - Inspect the Recycle Bin and `C:\Windows\Temp` for deleted or temporary files.

3. **Compute Hashes of Suspicious Files:**

   - Calculate MD5 and SHA-256 hashes of any suspicious executables found.

4. **Compare Hashes:**

   - Compare these hashes with those from Victim 1's `Minesweeperz.exe` to see if the same file exists on Victim 2.

5. **Report Back:**

   - Provide details of any malware samples found, including file paths, hashes, and timestamps.

**Please proceed with these steps and report back your findings for each section. Once we have this information, we can continue to fill in the remaining gaps in the attack chain.**
