### **General Malware Characteristics**
The sample is a **PE32+ executable** targeting 64-bit Windows environments. It utilizes **obfuscation techniques**, including **NOP instructions**, which may indicate attempts to evade signature-based detection systems. Moreover, the executable makes use of techniques such as **string decryption** and employs **evasive loops** (like sleep calls) to potentially bypass dynamic analysis tools.

- **File Hashes**:  
  - **MD5**: `d9e80958e631496ad165e2326162f956`
  - **SHA-1**: `ad74b8eb3bd3ec17b96d450a731b76a3866d92c6`
  - **SHA-256**: `ebf8020d148db05193c7ba5878569eb70b06e24903ed6ae0bff52a8de32c9b39`

The lack of digital signatures and low reputation scores across multiple antivirus engines further indicates this sample's malicious potential.

### **Anti-Analysis and Evasion Techniques**
1. **Sleep Loops**: The malware contains modified **Sleep()** API calls, which may be designed to stall the execution, forcing dynamic analysis environments to time out.
2. **Inlined NOP Instructions**: Found during static analysis, these instructions point to attempts to obfuscate real functionality and hinder reverse engineering efforts. They may act as padding or breakpoints in debugging environments.
3. **PE Sections with Non-Standard Names**: The executable's sections contain non-standard names, another indicator of code obfuscation or packing, often used by malware authors to evade heuristic and behavioral analysis.
4. **Minimal Activity**: The process was noted to be idle, further suggesting that Minesweeperz.exe may be lying dormant, awaiting specific triggers or conditions before unleashing its full payload.

These anti-analysis techniques are designed to make detection harder in automated sandboxes and during reverse engineering efforts.

### **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**
When analyzing this malware or similar threats, there are several critical IOCs to monitor for:

#### **File-Based IOCs**:
1. **File Hashes**: As noted earlier, any occurrence of these hashes (`d9e80958e631496ad165e2326162f956`, etc.) should raise an immediate red flag. Monitoring systems like SIEMs or endpoint detection systems for these file hashes will help identify infections.
   
2. **File Size**: **8.1 MB (8155648 bytes)** — While not the sole indicator, knowing the file size helps identify potentially compromised systems where the file is stored under different names.

3. **File Location**: In this case, the executable was launched from `C:\Users\user\Desktop\Minesweeperz.exe`. Watch for suspicious executable files in user directories (especially the Desktop, Downloads, or temporary folders).

#### **PE Header and Structure IOCs**:
- **Entry Point**: `0x459a00` in the `.text` section — A non-standard entry point may indicate tampering or packing.
- **Subsystem**: Windows GUI — While typical, non-signed GUI executables found in user-level directories are often part of malware delivery mechanisms.
- **Compilation Timestamp**: The **timestamp** of this sample was zeroed out (`0x0`), which is a common tactic used by malware authors to avoid detection through compiler-time analysis.

---

### **Registry Artifacts**
During execution, malware typically modifies or creates specific registry keys to ensure persistence or manipulate system settings. While no specific registry changes were documented in this report, the following are common registry-based artifacts to search for on infected systems:

1. **Startup Entries**:
   - Check for suspicious entries in the **Run** or **RunOnce** registry keys:
     - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
     - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
   These keys are often leveraged by malware to ensure execution upon system boot.

2. **Hidden Service Installations**:
   - Malware may install itself as a service and place entries in the **Services** registry key:
     - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`
   Inspect newly created or suspicious services that were added after the infection.

---

### **Network IOCs and Potential Exfiltration**
The analysis shows no direct network activity or contacted domains; however, it is common for malware to communicate with command and control (C2) servers or exfiltrate data. Potential network IOCs include:

1. **Suspicious Domains or IPs**: The malware did not contact any domains during the analysis, but on a live system, network traffic anomalies (e.g., connections to unknown or high-entropy domain names) should be examined. DNS tunneling or resolving dynamic domains could be a method of exfiltrating data.

2. **Encrypted or Compressed Traffic**: If a compromised system is exfiltrating data, it will likely do so through encrypted channels to avoid detection. Inspect for non-standard encryption protocols or outbound connections using SSL/TLS on unusual ports.

3. **Scheduled Tasks and Persistence via Network Behavior**: Malware might utilize scheduled tasks or other mechanisms to intermittently communicate with remote servers, even if no continuous traffic is detected.

---

### **Process and Memory Artifacts**
1. **Suspicious Process Trees**: The analyzed **Process Tree** shows Minesweeperz.exe (PID: 5112) launched without spawning additional processes. On infected systems, however, malware might spawn child processes for various malicious tasks (e.g., credential dumping, network scanning). Investigating the system's process tree for unexplained processes is critical.
   
2. **Memory Forensics**:
   - Use tools like **Volatility** to examine system memory and capture malicious artifacts residing in volatile memory. Look for injected code, processes with anomalous memory consumption, or unusual DLL loading activities.
   - **Strings in Memory**: Search memory dumps for encoded or decoded strings, which may reveal the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure or other payloads.

---

### **System Behavior and Artifacts**
Upon execution, the malware creates and modifies specific files and may tamper with system settings. Below are potential artifacts to examine:

1. **Dropped Files**:
   - The report indicates that **no files were dropped**, but live infections often lead to the creation of additional executables, DLLs, or configuration files. Searching for newly created or modified files with system forensic tools can reveal more about how the malware is operating.

2. **Mutexes**: Malware often creates mutex objects to ensure only one instance of the malicious process runs at a time. Use tools like **Process Explorer** to check for unknown or suspicious mutexes that might indicate Minesweeperz.exe's presence.

3. **Scheduled Tasks**: A common persistence mechanism involves the creation of scheduled tasks that ensure malware executes at system startup or regular intervals. Look for tasks in:
   - `C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\`

### **Detection and Mitigation**
Based on the behaviors observed during this analysis, security teams should focus on the following detection and mitigation strategies:

- **Monitor for IOCs**: Ensure that hashes, file paths, and behavioral IOCs related to **Minesweeperz.exe** are added to endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.
  
- **Memory Analysis**: Employ tools like **Volatility** to analyze memory dumps from suspected systems. Use the **malfind** plugin to detect process injection or code hiding techniques.

- **Network Monitoring**: Although no network activity was detected, monitor for abnormal outbound connections and set up alerts for suspicious or newly observed domains and IP addresses.

- **Behavioral Analysis**: Because of the file’s anti-analysis techniques, behavioral monitoring tools should track suspicious API calls (e.g., Sleep, LoadLibraryExA) and registry changes.

- **Patch Systems**: Ensure that systems are fully patched. While this sample did not directly exploit vulnerabilities, other malware using similar techniques may take advantage of known system weaknesses.

---

### **Conclusion**
The analysis of **Minesweeperz.exe** indicates that this executable employs multiple evasion techniques to avoid detection and has the potential to inflict significant damage on a system. While no significant network behavior or dropped files were observed, its use of anti-debugging, obfuscation, and potential persistence mechanisms make it a credible threat. Continuous monitoring, system forensics, and network traffic analysis are essential to identify, mitigate, and prevent further compromises from this malware or its variants.

### **File System and Registry Artifacts**

#### **File Operations**
The malware interacts with several critical Windows files, such as:

- **C:\Windows\AppPatch\sysmain.sdb**: This file is related to application compatibility and could be accessed by malware to manipulate system settings or remain hidden.
- **C:\Windows\System32\mswsock.dll**: This is a Windows system file related to network communications. Its interaction could signify attempts to modify or inspect network protocols.
- **C:\Windows\System32\hosts**: Reading the hosts file may indicate the malware is altering DNS settings to redirect traffic or block access to security updates.
  
These files should be inspected during forensic analysis for any unusual modifications or access times.

#### **Access to Network-Related Files**
Several files associated with network communication and protocols are accessed:

- **mswsock.dll**: A core Windows network service DLL, related to the WinSock API.
- **wshqos.dll**: A Quality of Service (QoS) API library that allows for the control of traffic management over networks.
- **winhttp.dll**: This is used for HTTP transactions. The access here could indicate that the malware was setting up or managing HTTP-based communication.

Additionally, the malware reads from the `hosts` file, potentially trying to block or redirect traffic by altering DNS resolutions, a common tactic in malware campaigns aiming to disrupt system updates or reroute web traffic to malicious servers.

#### **Registry Activities and Persistence**
Although this sample does not specifically create registry entries during this sandbox run, malware typically manipulates the registry to ensure persistence. Key areas to investigate for persistence mechanisms are:

- **Run Keys**: 
  - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
  - `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
  
  These keys can be leveraged by malware to ensure automatic execution upon system startup.

- **Registry Changes**:
  Malware can also modify registry keys to disable system protections or alter settings (e.g., disabling Windows Defender or Firewall).

---

### **Memory and Process Artifacts**

#### **Anti-Analysis Techniques**
Several anti-analysis techniques were detected, including:

- **NOP instructions**: Inline NOP (no operation) instructions were found, which could be indicative of obfuscated or shellcode-based malware. This is commonly used to bypass static analysis tools by confusing them or padding the code to make reverse engineering more difficult.
  
- **Sleep Calls**: The malware modified six sleep calls during its execution. This is often done to avoid detection by dynamic analysis environments like sandboxes, which may time out or skip over sleep periods to save time. The presence of these calls means the malware could have delayed execution for analysis evasion.

#### **Process Injection and Memory Manipulation**
Even though no explicit process injection was recorded, the malware exhibited behaviors commonly associated with injection techniques, such as loading libraries dynamically (`LoadLibraryExA` was invoked several times).

- **API Calls to Windows Functions**:
  - **LoadLibraryExA**: Used to load dynamic link libraries (DLLs) into the process, potentially indicating the presence of runtime DLL injection techniques.
  - **GetProcAddress**: The malware uses this API to resolve the address of a specific function in a DLL. Malware often uses this to locate API calls dynamically, making it harder to detect specific malicious behaviors statically.

Memory forensics tools like **Volatility** can be used to check for injected code in legitimate processes or anomalous memory usage patterns that could indicate process hollowing or DLL injection.

---

### **Network Behavior and Potential Command-and-Control Activity**

#### **Network APIs Used**
While there were no contacted domains or IP addresses in this specific sandbox environment, the malware accessed several network-related files and APIs:

- **GetAddrInfoW**: This function was called multiple times, which may indicate the malware is preparing for or managing DNS lookups. It could potentially be resolving domain names for command-and-control (C2) servers.
  
- **WSAEnumProtocolsW**: This API is used to enumerate available transport protocols, which suggests the malware might have been trying to identify network protocols available for communication or tunneling.

#### **Network Activity to Investigate**
On a compromised system, investigators should monitor for unusual network activity, particularly focusing on:

- **Outbound Connections**: Even though no specific IPs or domains were contacted in the sandbox, the malware might establish connections in real-world environments. Network monitoring should focus on:
  - Unusual outbound connections on common ports (HTTP: 80, HTTPS: 443) that may indicate C2 communications.
  - Suspicious domain lookups in DNS logs.
  
- **Modified Host File**: Since the malware reads from the host file, investigators should examine it for entries that could redirect legitimate traffic (e.g., to security update sites) to malicious IPs or block critical domains.

---

### **Disassembly and Code Insights**

The **dynamic execution coverage** of the malware was quite low (0%), suggesting that only a small fraction of its code was executed during the sandbox run. This could imply that the malware is highly evasive or requires specific triggers to fully activate. However, some insights into its structure were gathered:

- **Entrypoint Analysis**: The entry point of the malware is located at `0x459a00` in the `.text` section, which is standard for Windows executables. The entry point is critical for understanding the initial instructions the malware executes.
  
- **Non-Executed Functions**: Several functions were identified but not executed during the sandbox analysis, indicating that parts of the malware might remain dormant unless triggered by specific conditions, such as time, network activity, or user interaction.

---

### **Potential Artifacts and Forensic Investigation**

#### **Artifacts on Compromised System**
1. **File Paths and Artifacts**:
   - The malware was launched from `C:\Users\user\Desktop\Minesweeperz.exe`. Investigate user directories (Desktop, Downloads, and Temp) for the presence of the file or similarly named executables.
   
2. **Suspicious File Access**:
   - Monitor file access to critical system files like `hosts`, `mswsock.dll`, and `sysmain.sdb` for unusual activity, such as modification or high-frequency reads.

3. **Registry Modifications**:
   - Search for suspicious changes in startup keys or security-related configurations. The malware might attempt to modify registry values to disable defenses or ensure persistence.

4. **System Services**:
   - Investigate newly created or modified services that could have been installed by the malware for persistence.

5. **Network Forensics**:
   - Review network logs for anomalous DNS queries or outbound connections, particularly if you notice requests to unusual or high-entropy domain names.

#### **Memory Analysis**:
Tools like **Volatility** should be used to analyze memory dumps from a suspected compromised system. Look for:
- **Injected Code**: Malware may inject code into legitimate processes.
- **Suspicious Libraries**: Check for unusual DLLs loaded into the memory of critical system processes.

### **Conclusion**

Minesweeperz.exe demonstrates typical characteristics of evasive malware, employing anti-analysis techniques, obfuscation, and attempts at persistence. The malware interacts with various system files and may leverage network APIs to establish connections, although no specific C2 traffic was observed in this sandbox run. Forensic investigations should focus on file system modifications, network behavior, and in-memory indicators, as these will help identify the scope and impact of the infection on compromised systems. Monitoring these key artifacts and IOCs is crucial in detecting and mitigating the effects of this malware.
### Memory Activity Analysis for IOC Investigation

In the memory activities of **Minesweeperz.exe** (PID 5112), several key points indicate behaviors to focus on during an IOC investigation:

1. **Memory Allocation**:
   The process allocates significant memory regions, especially through the **VirtualAlloc** API, which reserves and commits memory. This is often used by malware to store decrypted code or payloads. The large blocks of reserved memory, such as `4194304` bytes, suggest possible payload storage or obfuscated code injection.

2. **Memory Protection Changes**:
   The executable changes memory protection several times (`page read and write` to `page readonly` and vice versa). This is commonly seen in malware when it loads or executes shellcode or encrypted payloads dynamically.

3. **Frequent API Calls**:
   Functions such as **LoadLibraryExA**, **GetProcAddress**, and **LdrInitializeThunk** are frequently invoked. These are often associated with dynamic library loading, code execution, and potential process injection.

### Key Findings for IOC:
- **Memory allocations via VirtualAlloc**, especially large ones, suggest a focus on memory dumps or forensic analysis.
- **Memory protection changes**: Track pages where protection is changed, as they are likely storing or executing injected code.
- **API activity**: Repeated loading of libraries and querying functions (via LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress) should be flagged in memory analysis tools.

These observations help highlight potential in-memory malicious activities.

In an IOC investigation, the **process activities** and **mutex activities** are particularly important, as they provide insight into how the malware interacts with the system and establishes persistence or synchronization. Here are key findings:

1. **Process Queried**: Several API calls like `LoadLibraryExA`, `GetProcAddress`, and `LdrInitializeThunk` are used to load libraries and manipulate process memory. This is often seen in malware that injects code or loads dynamic libraries stealthily.
   
2. **Mutex Created**: A mutex named `\Sessions\1\BaseNamedObjects\Local\SM0:5112:304:WilStaging_02` is created. Malware often creates mutexes to prevent multiple instances from running, which is crucial for persistence.

3. **File Activities**: The malware accesses several system files, including `sysmain.sdb` and `hosts`, suggesting network manipulation or system tampering.

These points serve as critical indicators to monitor during an investigation to detect compromised systems.
