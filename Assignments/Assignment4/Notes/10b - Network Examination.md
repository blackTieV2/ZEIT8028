Here’s the **corrected comprehensive status report** based on the new analysis, focusing on the recent clarification that the **large data transfers** were from IP **185.47.40.36** to **10.2.0.10**:

### **1. Background of Incident**
The investigation centers on the traffic between **185.47.40.36** (associated with the domain `filebin.net`) and **10.2.0.10**, captured during multiple TLS sessions on **October 14, 2019**. This traffic involves encrypted communication and has been scrutinized for potential signs of compromise, malware distribution, and data exfiltration.

### **2. Key Observations**
#### **IP Reputation and Malware Concerns**
- **IP 185.47.40.36**, owned by Redpill Linpro AS, Oslo, Norway (ASN AS39029), is **moderate-risk**.
- Historical involvement in **malware distribution**, **phishing**, **ransomware**, and **email spam campaigns**.
- Flagged by **AbuseIPDB** and **MalwareURL** with links to various malicious activities, including **Emotet**, **Magniber**, and **keyloggers**.
  
---

### **3. Network Traffic Analysis**
#### **DNS Queries (filebin.net)**
- Three DNS queries resolved **filebin.net** to **185.47.40.36**. These queries indicate that the target domain `filebin.net` (a known file-sharing service) was contacted by **10.2.0.10**, likely to initiate data transfer.

---

#### **TLS Session Analysis (10.2.0.10 ↔ 185.47.40.36)**
- **475 TLS packets** captured between **185.47.40.36** and **10.2.0.10**, with multiple **handshake**, **certificate exchanges**, and **data transfers**.
- Encrypted traffic from **185.47.40.36** to **10.2.0.10** suggests file-sharing or data retrieval activity.
  
##### **Handshake Summary**:
- TLS handshakes show **successful exchanges** of certificates and session setup, using **ECDHE-RSA-AES-256-GCM-SHA384** encryption.
- Handshake types: **1 (Client Hello)** and **2 (Server Hello)** with Let's Encrypt certificates issued for `filebin.net`.
- **JA3 Fingerprint** analysis identified normal, non-suspicious fingerprint values, though this does not eliminate the potential for malicious activity.

---

### **4. Data Transfer and Potential Concerns**
#### **Large Data Transfers**:
- **Large amounts of data were transferred** from **185.47.40.36** to **10.2.0.10** during the TLS session. This data flow, initially flagged as suspicious, involved a total transfer of **8,541,086 bytes**.
- This volume was over **encrypted TLS traffic** (recorded with `tls.record.content_type == 23`), suggesting **file retrieval or download** rather than exfiltration.

##### **Clarification of Data Direction**:
- The traffic direction was from **185.47.40.36** (filebin.net) **to 10.2.0.10**, indicating that **10.2.0.10** was receiving data, not exfiltrating it.
- The large transfer likely represents **data being downloaded** from **filebin.net** by the local host **10.2.0.10**, consistent with legitimate file-sharing use or malicious data being pulled by malware.

---

### **5. Suspicious Activity**
#### **Anomalies and Potential Risks**:
- While there’s no direct evidence of data exfiltration from **10.2.0.10**, the **large volume of data** received from a flagged IP (185.47.40.36) raises concerns about **malware download** or **C2 communication**.
- **Abnormal behavior**: Excessive TLS traffic for a brief window of time may indicate that **10.2.0.10** could have been pulling malware or additional payloads.
- **New Session Tickets (TLSv1.2)**: 2,367 packets showed New Session Tickets, which are part of establishing secure session resumption. While not directly suspicious, they reflect the ongoing establishment of secure sessions for further communication.

### **6. IP Addresses Associated with Investigation**
1. **52.229.207.60** (Microsoft Corporation): Legitimate cloud traffic, whitelisted, likely associated with Microsoft services.
2. **117.18.232.240** (EdgeCast Networks): Historical involvement in DDoS and outbound request patterns, flagged for suspicious traffic but not directly relevant to current activity.
3. **172.217.167.67** (Google LLC): Legitimate infrastructure linked to Google services, potentially benign.

---

### **7. Identified Risks and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**
- **IP Address**: **185.47.40.36** (linked to `filebin.net`) is flagged by multiple security platforms, involved in distributing malicious files and conducting phishing campaigns.
- **TLS Traffic**: Encrypted TLS traffic carrying **8.5 MB of data** from a flagged IP to a local host is concerning and needs further review to determine if the downloaded files were benign or malicious.

---

### **8. Next Steps**
1. **Examine the Content of the Downloaded Files**:
   - Identify the nature of the data received by **10.2.0.10** during the **TLS session** with **185.47.40.36**. If possible, check the disk or memory for suspicious files (especially if any file has been downloaded from **filebin.net**).
  
2. **Host Investigation on 10.2.0.10**:
   - Check for signs of malware infection or indicators of persistence mechanisms (e.g., registry changes, startup items).
   - Look for any **executed processes** around the time of the data transfer to **validate whether malware was executed**.

3. **Correlate Process Creation with Network Traffic**:
   - Use **process creation logs** to determine if there were any suspicious process launches (e.g., execution of **Minesweeperz.exe** or other potential malware) around the time of the network activity.

4. **Monitor the Network for Further Communication**:
   - Block **IP 185.47.40.36** if it hasn’t been blocked already.
   - Monitor for any further DNS queries or network traffic to suspicious domains or IPs.

---

### **Conclusion**
The investigation highlights the **potential risk of malware downloads** from **185.47.40.36** to **10.2.0.10**, primarily due to the **large data transfers** and the historical involvement of **filebin.net** in malicious activity. However, no direct evidence of data exfiltration was found, and further host-based analysis is recommended to confirm whether the data received was legitimate or part of a compromise. The suspicious **TLS traffic volume** and the flagged IP reputation remain significant concerns in this case.
