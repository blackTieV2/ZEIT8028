### Complete Analysis and Narrative of Compromise:

Let's break down the analysis of the various artifacts related to the "minesw" filter and connect it to your objectives of determining how the system was compromised, the extent of the compromise, and if any data was stolen.

### 1. **How were the computers compromised?**

   - **Initial Attack Vector**:
     - From the **Potential Browser Activity** and **Timeline Activity** data, the user accessed **several Minesweeper-related websites** around **14/10/2019 4:23 AM** to **4:46 AM**:
       - **Sites visited**: `freeminesweeper.org`, `play-minesweeper.com`, and `minesweeperonline.com`.
     - There is a suspicious download link, specifically noted in **Record 4** of the **Potential Browser Activity**:
       - **URL**: `https://filebin.net/qkzfz4ixazs73hb8/Minesweeperz.exe`, indicating a direct download of the **`Minesweeperz.exe`** malware file.

   - **Document/Link Used**:
     - The initial malware executable, **`Minesweeperz.exe`**, was downloaded from the link mentioned above. This file was executed multiple times according to the **Prefetch files** and **LogFile Analysis**.
     - The **Edge Cache Data** and **Browser History** confirm interactions with these sites right before the file download and execution.

   - **Compromise Process**:
     - After downloading **`Minesweeperz.exe`** from the malicious URL, it was executed as observed in the **Prefetch Files** data, where it was executed **4 times** between **4:25 AM** and **4:46 AM**.

### 2. **Extent of the Compromise:**

   - **Second and Third Stage of Infection**:
     - **Second Stage**: Execution of **PowerShell scripts** likely served as the second stage of infection. Multiple **PowerShell events** were noted in the **Windows Event Logs**, running at the same time as `Minesweeperz.exe`. This implies that PowerShell was used to further the infectionâ€”possibly downloading additional payloads or establishing persistence.
     - **Third Stage**: The `Minesweeperz.exe` process likely spawned additional actions, potentially calling back to a remote server and persisting through PowerShell or registry keys.

   - **Actions on Target**:
     - **File Deletion**: The malware attempted to **delete `Minesweeperz.exe`** after execution (as noted in the **LogFile Analysis**), possibly to hide its traces.
     - **Prefetch Files**: Indicate that the malware was executed several times, supporting the idea that it performed multiple actions.
     - **Google Analytics Session Cookies** and **Edge Cookies**: Show cookies related to **freeminesweeper.org**, indicating that browser-based tracking or user activity could have been monitored.

   - **Callback to Implant**:
     - The **SRUM Network Usage** should be further analyzed for any unusual outbound connections, as it's likely the malware was calling back to a Command and Control (C2) server after execution.

   - **Persistence Mechanism**:
     - The **PowerShell executions** and **event logs** indicate that PowerShell scripts were likely used to **persist access** or further infect the system. Investigating registry entries or scheduled tasks should be a priority to confirm persistence methods.

### 3. **Was anything taken?**

   - **Information Stolen**:
     - Given the nature of the infection, it's possible that **browser session data** (e.g., cookies, analytics data) was compromised. The **Google Analytics Cookies** and **Browser Cache** show that activity from **`freeminesweeper.org`** was monitored.
     - If the malware leveraged PowerShell for **network activity**, there is a possibility that sensitive information, such as credentials or browsing history, was exfiltrated.
     - Further investigation of the **SRUM Network Usage** and **application resource spikes** can provide insight into what data was transferred or stolen from the host.

### Narrative of Compromise:

- The initial compromise occurred when the user visited **Minesweeper-related websites** and downloaded **`Minesweeperz.exe`** from a malicious link. Upon execution, this malware leveraged **PowerShell scripts** to persist and potentially download additional payloads or exfiltrate data.
  
- The compromise included multiple executions of **`Minesweeperz.exe`**, with attempts to clean up traces by deleting the file. Browser activity, including **session cookies** and **cache data**, was likely accessed or compromised during the infection window, and further outbound network connections likely occurred, which need to be correlated with the **SRUM Network Usage**.

This narrative provides a full picture of how the malware infection occurred, its impact on the system, and the potential for stolen data.
