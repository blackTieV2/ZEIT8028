### **Notes on Missing Evidence or Links**

- **Source of Administrative Credentials**: There is insufficient evidence to determine how `p.exe` obtained administrative credentials to access Victim 2. Possible explanations include credential theft from Victim 1 or exploitation of weak/default passwords.

- **Confirmation of Data Exfiltration**: Network traffic indicates a large data transfer from Victim 2 to external IP `117.18.232.240`, which is associated with suspicious activities. However, there is no direct evidence confirming that `exfil.zip` was the data transferred due to the incomplete PCAP capture.

- **Activities Performed by `spoolvs.exe`**: Detailed actions of `spoolvs.exe` on Victim 2 remain unclear due to possible log tampering or deletion using `sdelete.exe`.

### **Notes on Evidence**

- **Execution of `sdelete64.exe`**: The only records indicating activity of `sdelete64.exe` after the `Minesweeperz.exe` event are from **October 14, 2019, 04:57:01 UTC**, based on the prefetch file modifications found in the System Volume Information. This suggests that `sdelete64.exe` was executed on Victim 2 shortly after the creation of `exfil.zip`.

- **Activities Performed by `spoolvs.exe`**: `spoolvs.exe` was created, registered as a service, and executed multiple times on Victim 2. Its execution via PowerShell indicates it may have been used to perform malicious activities, such as facilitating the creation of `exfil.zip` or maintaining persistence.

- **Confirmation of Data Exfiltration**: Network traffic indicates a large data transfer from Victim 2 to external IP `117.18.232.240`, associated with suspicious activities. While the PCAP file ends before confirming the complete transfer, the timing aligns with the creation of `exfil.zip`, supporting the likelihood of exfiltration.

- **Source of Administrative Credentials**: There is insufficient evidence to determine how `p.exe` obtained administrative credentials to access Victim 2. Possible explanations include credential theft from Victim 1 or exploitation of weak/default passwords.

|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Minesweeperz.exe`          | Initial malware downloaded and executed by Craig; acted as a dropper for other malicious tools (`a.exe`, `p.exe`). |
| `a.exe`                     | Network scanning tool used to identify other devices (Victim 2) on the network for lateral movement.             |
| `p.exe`                     | Malicious PsExec variant used to execute commands remotely on Victim 2 from Victim 1.                            |
| `PSEXESVC.exe`              | Service component deployed on Victim 2 by `p.exe` to facilitate remote command execution.                        |
| `spoolvs.exe`               | Malicious executable masquerading as legitimate `spoolsv.exe`; installed as a service on Victim 2 for persistence. |
| `sdelete64.exe`             | Secure deletion tool potentially used to erase evidence of malicious activities on Victim 2.                     |
| `powershell.exe`            | Used to execute scripts and commands for further exploitation and creating `exfil.zip`.                          |
| **`exfil.zip`**             | Archive containing sensitive files (`SAM` and `SYSTEM`); created on Victim 2 and potentially exfiltrated externally. |
| **`SAM` and `SYSTEM` files**| Critical system files extracted and compressed into `exfil.zip`; contain hashed passwords and system configurations. |
| **Network Traffic Logs**    | Showed communications with external IPs and between Victim 1 and Victim 2, including potential exfiltration traffic. |
| Prefetch Files              | Indicated execution of malicious executables and helped establish the timeline of events.                       |
| PowerShell Event Logs       | Captured execution of scripts used to create `exfil.zip` and possibly other malicious activities.                |
| Security Event Logs         | Recorded authentication attempts and service installations, crucial for tracing the attack progression.          |
| Shim Cache Entries          | Showed execution of `spoolvs.exe` and `sdelete64.exe`, indicating attempts to maintain access and cover tracks.  |
| **PCAP Files**              | Network packet captures showing data transfers to external IP `117.18.232.240`; used in exfiltration analysis.   |
| **External IP Abuse Reports**| Provided context on the external IP's history of abuse, supporting the likelihood of malicious activity.         |
