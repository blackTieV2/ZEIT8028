### **Notes on Missing Evidence or Links**

- **Creation and Transfer of `exfil.zip`**: While there is evidence of `exfil.zip` being created at **04:40:00 UTC**, concrete evidence of its transfer to an external server is not present in the available data. Network logs indicate connections to external IP addresses, but we lack direct evidence of `exfil.zip` being exfiltrated.
- **Use of Credentials for Lateral Movement**: Evidence suggests that `p.exe` used administrative credentials to connect to Victim 2, but the source of these credentials is not definitively identified in the logs.
- **Actions Performed by `spoolvs.exe`**: Detailed activities performed by `spoolvs.exe` on Victim 2 are not fully captured due to possible log deletion by `sdelete.exe`.

## Key Artifacts and Their Roles

| **Artifact**           | **Role in Attack**                                                                                             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Minesweeperz.exe`     | Initial malware downloaded and executed by Craig; acted as a dropper for other malicious tools.                |
| `a.exe`                | Network scanning tool used to discover other devices (e.g., Victim 2) on the network for lateral movement.     |
| `p.exe`                | Malicious variant of PsExec used to execute commands remotely on Victim 2 from Victim 1.                        |
| `PSEXESVC.exe`         | Service component deployed on Victim 2 by `p.exe` to facilitate remote command execution.                      |
| `spoolvs.exe`          | Malicious executable mimicking legitimate `spoolsv.exe`; installed as a service on Victim 2 for persistence.   |
| `sdelete.exe`          | Secure deletion tool used to erase evidence of malicious activities on Victim 1 and possibly Victim 2.         |
| `Cheat Engine.exe`     | Utility found in memory, potentially used for process manipulation or memory injection to aid the attack.      |
| `powershell.exe`       | Used to execute scripts and commands for further exploitation and maintaining control over the systems.        |
| `exfil.zip`            | Archive potentially containing exfiltrated data; created on Victim 1 and possibly transferred externally.      |
| Network Traffic Logs   | Captured evidence of communications with external IP addresses and between Victim 1 and Victim 2.              |
| Execution Prefetch Files | Indicated execution of malicious executables and helped establish the timeline of events.                   |
| USN Journal Entries    | Provided records of file creations, modifications, and deletions, including those attempted to be erased.       |
| Security Event Logs    | Recorded authentication attempts and service installations, crucial for tracing the attack progression.        |
