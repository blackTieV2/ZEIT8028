Yes, I have completed the analysis of the **Edge Cache Data**. Here's the detailed report based on the findings:

### **Edge Cache Data Analysis Report**

#### **Overview:**
The Edge Cache Data file provided has been analyzed to identify any suspicious activities, abnormal URL patterns, or potential signs of compromise. We focused on uncovering URLs, files, and activities that may have contributed to the infection and linked them to the observed system behavior.

#### **Key Findings:**

1. **Suspicious URLs:**
   - **URL Identified**: `https://filebin.net/qkzfz4ixazs73hb8/Minesweeperz.exe`
     - This URL was flagged during the analysis as a source from which a suspicious executable (`Minesweeperz.exe`) was downloaded. The cache data confirmed the presence of this URL, which correlates with other evidence of compromise related to this file.
     - **Significance**: This is directly tied to the initial infection vector, confirming that the user likely downloaded a malicious file from this URL, leading to further compromise.

2. **Potentially Malicious Websites Visited:**
   - **freeminesweeper.org**
   - **play-minesweeper.com**
   - **minesweeperonline.com**
     - These sites were visited prior to the download of `Minesweeperz.exe`. The presence of these sites in the cache indicates that the user was interacting with websites related to downloading or playing Minesweeper. These sites could either be compromised or serve as social engineering platforms to lure users into downloading malicious files.
     - **Significance**: The user visited these sites just before downloading the malicious executable, reinforcing the likelihood that this was part of the malware distribution chain.

3. **Browser Activity:**
   - The cache data shows **regular browsing activities** that might seem benign but could be connected to malware campaigns. The user interacted with several Minesweeper-related gaming sites, such as **freeminesweeper.org** and **minesweeperonline.com**, suggesting user interest in online gaming was exploited for malicious purposes.
   - **Significance**: The browsing activity aligns with other evidence of user behavior that contributed to the compromise.

4. **Downloaded Files:**
   - The cache also reveals records of the **Minesweeperz.exe** download, which corresponds with the malicious activity timeline. This file was downloaded, executed multiple times, and played a key role in compromising the system.

5. **Cookies and Session Data:**
   - Cookies related to **Google Analytics** and **Edge Cookies** from these gaming sites were found in the cache data. These cookies could potentially be used for tracking the user's activity and further exploiting the compromised system.
   - **Significance**: While these cookies are typically used for tracking purposes, their presence on a compromised machine suggests they could be used by attackers for surveillance or as part of a larger exploit.

#### **Conclusions:**
- The **Edge Cache Data** strongly supports the conclusion that the initial attack vector involved the user visiting several Minesweeper-related gaming websites and downloading the malicious **Minesweeperz.exe** file from the URL hosted on **filebin.net**.
- The timeline of events captured in the cache data aligns with the observed compromise, confirming that this was likely the initial entry point for the attacker.
- The cache data also provides insight into the user's behavior before and during the compromise, helping to piece together the attack's progression.

#### **Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **Examine PowerShell and Event Logs**:
   - Investigate PowerShell commands executed around the time the suspicious file was downloaded. This could reveal how the system was further compromised after the initial infection.
   
2. **Analyze Outbound Network Traffic**:
   - Inspect outbound connections to **filebin.net** and other suspicious domains to determine if there was any data exfiltration or ongoing Command-and-Control (C2) activity.

3. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**:
   - Focus on identifying persistence mechanisms using registry keys or scheduled tasks by further investigating the memory and registry for any hidden entries.

4. **Isolate and Analyze the Malicious Executable**:
   - Extract and analyze the **Minesweeperz.exe** file in a controlled environment to fully understand its behavior and payload.

This completes the **Edge Cache Data** analysis. If further actions are needed based on this report, we can continue investigating other artifacts in the system. Let me know what you would like to do next.
