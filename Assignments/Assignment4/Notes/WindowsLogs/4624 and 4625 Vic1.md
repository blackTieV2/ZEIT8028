### Detailed Report on the Windows Event Log Analysis Artifact (Victim 01)

**Artifact Overview:**
This report examines Windows Event Logs extracted from "Victim 01." The focus is on analyzing Event IDs 4624 (successful logon attempts) and 4625 (failed logon attempts) to identify authentication activities that could indicate the initial access vector or lateral movement attempts by the attacker.

---

### Key Findings:

#### **Event ID 4625 (Failed Logon Attempts)**
- **Event Type**: Failed login attempts.
- **Event ID**: 4625.
- **Date/Time**: Multiple entries, including **October 10, 2019**.
- **Operation**: Captured failed login attempts on Victim 01.
- **Log Path**: Logs located in the `Security.evtx` file.

  - **October 10, 2019, 1:15:06 PM**: Failed login event on **WININT3-9LDHUKE** using **Logon Type 2** (interactive). Failure reason: **0xC000006D** (invalid credentials).
  
  - **October 10, 2019, 6:21:11 AM**: Failed logon on **machine**, error status **0xC000006D**, likely an incorrect password or unauthorized access attempt.
  
  - **October 14, 2019, 3:37:51 AM**: Additional failed logon attempts on **machine** with similar details, indicating repeated access attempts with invalid credentials.
  
  - **October 14, 2019, 3:46:33 AM**: Failed login on **WORKSTATION02** under user **Alan**, status **0xC000006D**, suggesting password issues.

#### **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon Attempts)**
- **Event Type**: Successful login events.
- **Event ID**: 4624.
- **Date/Time**: Multiple entries, including **October 10, 2019**.
- **Operation**: SYSTEM and service logons captured in the logs.
- **Log Path**: Logs located in the `Security.evtx` file.

  - **October 10, 2019, 1:14:50 PM**: Successful logon event for **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM** under **Logon Type 5** (service logon). This indicates SYSTEM-level processes were initiated on the system.
  
  - **October 10, 2019, 1:15:50 PM**: Another SYSTEM-level logon occurred shortly after, confirming that service or SYSTEM processes were active on Victim 01.

### Evidence and Offsets:
- **File Offsets**:
  - **October 10, 2019, 1:15:06 PM**: File Offset **4507564472** (failed logon attempt).
  - **October 10, 2019, 1:14:50 PM**: File Offset **4507543211** (successful SYSTEM logon).

---

### Analysis:

The failed logon events on Victim 01 suggest the attacker was attempting to access the system using either stolen or guessed credentials. The repeated failed logon attempts, especially under Logon Type 2 (interactive logon), indicate manual attempts to gain access.

Following the failed attempts, there are successful logon events under **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**, showing that SYSTEM-level processes were initiated on the victim machine. This could indicate that the attacker eventually gained elevated privileges through SYSTEM-level service logons, potentially after compromising an administrative account or using privilege escalation techniques.

### Timeline of Events:
- **October 10, 2019, 1:14 PM**: Successful SYSTEM logon on Victim 01, indicating service-level or administrative actions.
- **October 10, 2019, 1:15 PM**: Multiple failed logon attempts, suggesting brute force or password guessing attempts on the victim.
- **October 14, 2019, 3:46 AM**: Repeated failed login attempts, especially targeting the user "Alan" on WORKSTATION02, indicating continued efforts to compromise additional accounts or escalate privileges.

---

### Conclusion:
The Windows Event Logs from Victim 01 reveal a series of failed logon attempts, followed by successful SYSTEM logons, suggesting that the attacker gained access after repeated credential-based attacks. The log entries show clear indications of unauthorized access attempts, followed by SYSTEM-level logon success. These events likely represent part of the attacker's lateral movement strategy, possibly leveraging compromised accounts or privilege escalation to access Victim 02.

### Next Steps:
1. **Network Traffic Review**: Examine network traffic logs for SMB sessions or RDP connections to determine how the attacker moved laterally.
2. **Tools Analysis**: Look for PsExec, WMI, or scheduled tasks evidence within the system that could indicate tools used for lateral movement.
3. **Additional Log Review**: Review system and application logs for additional authentication events or evidence of malware propagation.

Please provide network logs or any system-level traces to proceed further in investigating the attacker's lateral movement and persistence mechanisms.
