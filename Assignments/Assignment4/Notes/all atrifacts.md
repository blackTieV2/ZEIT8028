### Detailed Malware Analysis Report: **Minesweeperz.exe**

**Introduction:**
The **Minesweeperz.exe** sample, analyzed in Joe Sandbox (Analysis ID: 433940), exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious activities, including anti-analysis techniques, potential obfuscation, and code designed to hinder detection. With a detection score of **56/100**, the executable was flagged by various security mechanisms as suspicious, with **Avira** detecting it as **HEUR/AGEN.1138547**. This analysis aims to break down its technical characteristics, highlight Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and detail potential artifacts that may appear on a compromised system.

---

### **General Malware Characteristics**
The sample is a **PE32+ executable** targeting 64-bit Windows environments. It utilizes **obfuscation techniques**, including **NOP instructions**, which may indicate attempts to evade signature-based detection systems. Moreover, the executable makes use of techniques such as **string decryption** and employs **evasive loops** (like sleep calls) to potentially bypass dynamic analysis tools.

- **File Hashes**:  
  - **MD5**: `d9e80958e631496ad165e2326162f956`
  - **SHA-1**: `ad74b8eb3bd3ec17b96d450a731b76a3866d92c6`
  - **SHA-256**: `ebf8020d148db05193c7ba5878569eb70b06e24903ed6ae0bff52a8de32c9b39`

The lack of digital signatures and low reputation scores across multiple antivirus engines further indicates this sample's malicious potential.

### **Anti-Analysis and Evasion Techniques**
1. **Sleep Loops**: The malware contains modified **Sleep()** API calls, which may be designed to stall the execution, forcing dynamic analysis environments to time out.
2. **Inlined NOP Instructions**: Found during static analysis, these instructions point to attempts to obfuscate real functionality and hinder reverse engineering efforts. They may act as padding or breakpoints in debugging environments.
3. **PE Sections with Non-Standard Names**: The executable's sections contain non-standard names, another indicator of code obfuscation or packing, often used by malware authors to evade heuristic and behavioral analysis.
4. **Minimal Activity**: The process was noted to be idle, further suggesting that Minesweeperz.exe may be lying dormant, awaiting specific triggers or conditions before unleashing its full payload.

These anti-analysis techniques are designed to make detection harder in automated sandboxes and during reverse engineering efforts.

---

### **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**
When analyzing this malware or similar threats, there are several critical IOCs to monitor for:

#### **File-Based IOCs**:
1. **File Hashes**: As noted earlier, any occurrence of these hashes (`d9e80958e631496ad165e2326162f956`, etc.) should raise an immediate red flag. Monitoring systems like SIEMs or endpoint detection systems for these file hashes will help identify infections.
   
2. **File Size**: **8.1 MB (8155648 bytes)** — While not the sole indicator, knowing the file size helps identify potentially compromised systems where the file is stored under different names.

3. **File Location**: In this case, the executable was launched from `C:\Users\user\Desktop\Minesweeperz.exe`. Watch for suspicious executable files in user directories (especially the Desktop, Downloads, or temporary folders).

#### **PE Header and Structure IOCs**:
- **Entry Point**: `0x459a00` in the `.text` section — A non-standard entry point may indicate tampering or packing.
- **Subsystem**: Windows GUI — While typical, non-signed GUI executables found in user-level directories are often part of malware delivery mechanisms.
- **Compilation Timestamp**: The **timestamp** of this sample was zeroed out (`0x0`), which is a common tactic used by malware authors to avoid detection through compiler-time analysis.

---

### **Registry Artifacts**
During execution, malware typically modifies or creates specific registry keys to ensure persistence or manipulate system settings. While no specific registry changes were documented in this report, the following are common registry-based artifacts to search for on infected systems:

1. **Startup Entries**:
   - Check for suspicious entries in the **Run** or **RunOnce** registry keys:
     - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
     - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
   These keys are often leveraged by malware to ensure execution upon system boot.

2. **Hidden Service Installations**:
   - Malware may install itself as a service and place entries in the **Services** registry key:
     - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`
   Inspect newly created or suspicious services that were added after the infection.

---

### **Network IOCs and Potential Exfiltration**
The analysis shows no direct network activity or contacted domains; however, it is common for malware to communicate with command and control (C2) servers or exfiltrate data. Potential network IOCs include:

1. **Suspicious Domains or IPs**: The malware did not contact any domains during the analysis, but on a live system, network traffic anomalies (e.g., connections to unknown or high-entropy domain names) should be examined. DNS tunneling or resolving dynamic domains could be a method of exfiltrating data.

2. **Encrypted or Compressed Traffic**: If a compromised system is exfiltrating data, it will likely do so through encrypted channels to avoid detection. Inspect for non-standard encryption protocols or outbound connections using SSL/TLS on unusual ports.

3. **Scheduled Tasks and Persistence via Network Behavior**: Malware might utilize scheduled tasks or other mechanisms to intermittently communicate with remote servers, even if no continuous traffic is detected.

---

### **Process and Memory Artifacts**
1. **Suspicious Process Trees**: The analyzed **Process Tree** shows Minesweeperz.exe (PID: 5112) launched without spawning additional processes. On infected systems, however, malware might spawn child processes for various malicious tasks (e.g., credential dumping, network scanning). Investigating the system's process tree for unexplained processes is critical.
   
2. **Memory Forensics**:
   - Use tools like **Volatility** to examine system memory and capture malicious artifacts residing in volatile memory. Look for injected code, processes with anomalous memory consumption, or unusual DLL loading activities.
   - **Strings in Memory**: Search memory dumps for encoded or decoded strings, which may reveal the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure or other payloads.

---

### **System Behavior and Artifacts**
Upon execution, the malware creates and modifies specific files and may tamper with system settings. Below are potential artifacts to examine:

1. **Dropped Files**:
   - The report indicates that **no files were dropped**, but live infections often lead to the creation of additional executables, DLLs, or configuration files. Searching for newly created or modified files with system forensic tools can reveal more about how the malware is operating.

2. **Mutexes**: Malware often creates mutex objects to ensure only one instance of the malicious process runs at a time. Use tools like **Process Explorer** to check for unknown or suspicious mutexes that might indicate Minesweeperz.exe's presence.

3. **Scheduled Tasks**: A common persistence mechanism involves the creation of scheduled tasks that ensure malware executes at system startup or regular intervals. Look for tasks in:
   - `C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\`
   
---

### **Detection and Mitigation**
Based on the behaviors observed during this analysis, security teams should focus on the following detection and mitigation strategies:

- **Monitor for IOCs**: Ensure that hashes, file paths, and behavioral IOCs related to **Minesweeperz.exe** are added to endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.
  
- **Memory Analysis**: Employ tools like **Volatility** to analyze memory dumps from suspected systems. Use the **malfind** plugin to detect process injection or code hiding techniques.

- **Network Monitoring**: Although no network activity was detected, monitor for abnormal outbound connections and set up alerts for suspicious or newly observed domains and IP addresses.

- **Behavioral Analysis**: Because of the file’s anti-analysis techniques, behavioral monitoring tools should track suspicious API calls (e.g., Sleep, LoadLibraryExA) and registry changes.

- **Patch Systems**: Ensure that systems are fully patched. While this sample did not directly exploit vulnerabilities, other malware using similar techniques may take advantage of known system weaknesses.

---

### **Conclusion**
The analysis of **Minesweeperz.exe** indicates that this executable employs multiple evasion techniques to avoid detection and has the potential to inflict significant damage on a system. While no significant network behavior or dropped files were observed, its use of anti-debugging, obfuscation, and potential persistence mechanisms make it a credible threat. Continuous monitoring, system forensics, and network traffic analysis are essential to identify, mitigate, and prevent further compromises from this malware or its variants.
---

### **File System and Registry Artifacts**

#### **File Operations**
The malware interacts with several critical Windows files, such as:

- **C:\Windows\AppPatch\sysmain.sdb**: This file is related to application compatibility and could be accessed by malware to manipulate system settings or remain hidden.
- **C:\Windows\System32\mswsock.dll**: This is a Windows system file related to network communications. Its interaction could signify attempts to modify or inspect network protocols.
- **C:\Windows\System32\hosts**: Reading the hosts file may indicate the malware is altering DNS settings to redirect traffic or block access to security updates.
  
These files should be inspected during forensic analysis for any unusual modifications or access times.

#### **Access to Network-Related Files**
Several files associated with network communication and protocols are accessed:

- **mswsock.dll**: A core Windows network service DLL, related to the WinSock API.
- **wshqos.dll**: A Quality of Service (QoS) API library that allows for the control of traffic management over networks.
- **winhttp.dll**: This is used for HTTP transactions. The access here could indicate that the malware was setting up or managing HTTP-based communication.

Additionally, the malware reads from the `hosts` file, potentially trying to block or redirect traffic by altering DNS resolutions, a common tactic in malware campaigns aiming to disrupt system updates or reroute web traffic to malicious servers.

#### **Registry Activities and Persistence**
Although this sample does not specifically create registry entries during this sandbox run, malware typically manipulates the registry to ensure persistence. Key areas to investigate for persistence mechanisms are:

- **Run Keys**: 
  - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
  - `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
  
  These keys can be leveraged by malware to ensure automatic execution upon system startup.

- **Registry Changes**:
  Malware can also modify registry keys to disable system protections or alter settings (e.g., disabling Windows Defender or Firewall).

---

### **Memory and Process Artifacts**

#### **Anti-Analysis Techniques**
Several anti-analysis techniques were detected, including:

- **NOP instructions**: Inline NOP (no operation) instructions were found, which could be indicative of obfuscated or shellcode-based malware. This is commonly used to bypass static analysis tools by confusing them or padding the code to make reverse engineering more difficult.
  
- **Sleep Calls**: The malware modified six sleep calls during its execution. This is often done to avoid detection by dynamic analysis environments like sandboxes, which may time out or skip over sleep periods to save time. The presence of these calls means the malware could have delayed execution for analysis evasion.

#### **Process Injection and Memory Manipulation**
Even though no explicit process injection was recorded, the malware exhibited behaviors commonly associated with injection techniques, such as loading libraries dynamically (`LoadLibraryExA` was invoked several times).

- **API Calls to Windows Functions**:
  - **LoadLibraryExA**: Used to load dynamic link libraries (DLLs) into the process, potentially indicating the presence of runtime DLL injection techniques.
  - **GetProcAddress**: The malware uses this API to resolve the address of a specific function in a DLL. Malware often uses this to locate API calls dynamically, making it harder to detect specific malicious behaviors statically.

Memory forensics tools like **Volatility** can be used to check for injected code in legitimate processes or anomalous memory usage patterns that could indicate process hollowing or DLL injection.

---

### **Network Behavior and Potential Command-and-Control Activity**

#### **Network APIs Used**
While there were no contacted domains or IP addresses in this specific sandbox environment, the malware accessed several network-related files and APIs:

- **GetAddrInfoW**: This function was called multiple times, which may indicate the malware is preparing for or managing DNS lookups. It could potentially be resolving domain names for command-and-control (C2) servers.
  
- **WSAEnumProtocolsW**: This API is used to enumerate available transport protocols, which suggests the malware might have been trying to identify network protocols available for communication or tunneling.

#### **Network Activity to Investigate**
On a compromised system, investigators should monitor for unusual network activity, particularly focusing on:

- **Outbound Connections**: Even though no specific IPs or domains were contacted in the sandbox, the malware might establish connections in real-world environments. Network monitoring should focus on:
  - Unusual outbound connections on common ports (HTTP: 80, HTTPS: 443) that may indicate C2 communications.
  - Suspicious domain lookups in DNS logs.
  
- **Modified Host File**: Since the malware reads from the host file, investigators should examine it for entries that could redirect legitimate traffic (e.g., to security update sites) to malicious IPs or block critical domains.

---

### **Disassembly and Code Insights**

The **dynamic execution coverage** of the malware was quite low (0%), suggesting that only a small fraction of its code was executed during the sandbox run. This could imply that the malware is highly evasive or requires specific triggers to fully activate. However, some insights into its structure were gathered:

- **Entrypoint Analysis**: The entry point of the malware is located at `0x459a00` in the `.text` section, which is standard for Windows executables. The entry point is critical for understanding the initial instructions the malware executes.
  
- **Non-Executed Functions**: Several functions were identified but not executed during the sandbox analysis, indicating that parts of the malware might remain dormant unless triggered by specific conditions, such as time, network activity, or user interaction.

---

### **Potential Artifacts and Forensic Investigation**

#### **Artifacts on Compromised System**
1. **File Paths and Artifacts**:
   - The malware was launched from `C:\Users\user\Desktop\Minesweeperz.exe`. Investigate user directories (Desktop, Downloads, and Temp) for the presence of the file or similarly named executables.
   
2. **Suspicious File Access**:
   - Monitor file access to critical system files like `hosts`, `mswsock.dll`, and `sysmain.sdb` for unusual activity, such as modification or high-frequency reads.

3. **Registry Modifications**:
   - Search for suspicious changes in startup keys or security-related configurations. The malware might attempt to modify registry values to disable defenses or ensure persistence.

4. **System Services**:
   - Investigate newly created or modified services that could have been installed by the malware for persistence.

5. **Network Forensics**:
   - Review network logs for anomalous DNS queries or outbound connections, particularly if you notice requests to unusual or high-entropy domain names.

#### **Memory Analysis**:
Tools like **Volatility** should be used to analyze memory dumps from a suspected compromised system. Look for:
- **Injected Code**: Malware may inject code into legitimate processes.
- **Suspicious Libraries**: Check for unusual DLLs loaded into the memory of critical system processes.

---

### **Conclusion**

Minesweeperz.exe demonstrates typical characteristics of evasive malware, employing anti-analysis techniques, obfuscation, and attempts at persistence. The malware interacts with various system files and may leverage network APIs to establish connections, although no specific C2 traffic was observed in this sandbox run. Forensic investigations should focus on file system modifications, network behavior, and in-memory indicators, as these will help identify the scope and impact of the infection on compromised systems. Monitoring these key artifacts and IOCs is crucial in detecting and mitigating the effects of this malware.
### Memory Activity Analysis for IOC Investigation

In the memory activities of **Minesweeperz.exe** (PID 5112), several key points indicate behaviors to focus on during an IOC investigation:

1. **Memory Allocation**:
   The process allocates significant memory regions, especially through the **VirtualAlloc** API, which reserves and commits memory. This is often used by malware to store decrypted code or payloads. The large blocks of reserved memory, such as `4194304` bytes, suggest possible payload storage or obfuscated code injection.

2. **Memory Protection Changes**:
   The executable changes memory protection several times (`page read and write` to `page readonly` and vice versa). This is commonly seen in malware when it loads or executes shellcode or encrypted payloads dynamically.

3. **Frequent API Calls**:
   Functions such as **LoadLibraryExA**, **GetProcAddress**, and **LdrInitializeThunk** are frequently invoked. These are often associated with dynamic library loading, code execution, and potential process injection.

### Key Findings for IOC:
- **Memory allocations via VirtualAlloc**, especially large ones, suggest a focus on memory dumps or forensic analysis.
- **Memory protection changes**: Track pages where protection is changed, as they are likely storing or executing injected code.
- **API activity**: Repeated loading of libraries and querying functions (via LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress) should be flagged in memory analysis tools.

These observations help highlight potential in-memory malicious activities.

In an IOC investigation, the **process activities** and **mutex activities** are particularly important, as they provide insight into how the malware interacts with the system and establishes persistence or synchronization. Here are key findings:

1. **Process Queried**: Several API calls like `LoadLibraryExA`, `GetProcAddress`, and `LdrInitializeThunk` are used to load libraries and manipulate process memory. This is often seen in malware that injects code or loads dynamic libraries stealthily.
   
2. **Mutex Created**: A mutex named `\Sessions\1\BaseNamedObjects\Local\SM0:5112:304:WilStaging_02` is created. Malware often creates mutexes to prevent multiple instances from running, which is crucial for persistence.

3. **File Activities**: The malware accesses several system files, including `sysmain.sdb` and `hosts`, suggesting network manipulation or system tampering.

These points serve as critical indicators to monitor during an investigation to detect compromised systems.

## Procdump PEs
I understand the importance of having complete details, and I’ll ensure to give you a full record. You’re right—there were **three suspected PE files** (Portable Executables) flagged in your previous VirusTotal scans, but I only provided details for **two**. Let's correct that.

I'll provide a complete log record for all **three PE files**, including their **SHA-256 hashes** and an analysis in the context of your investigation.

### 1. **PowerShell (PID 7592)**
   - **File**: `executable.7592.exe`
   - **SHA-256**: `21c335dac685f3e721235aafd163ffac8f74051970cefa7ae40330143e7dec96`
   - **Flagged by**: **CrowdStrike Falcon** (60% confidence of being malicious)
   - **Analysis**:
     - **PowerShell** is a common target for attackers due to its flexibility and ability to execute scripts remotely. In this case, the process is flagged as **malicious** with signs of running in a **debug environment**, which is concerning.
     - The **communication** with external IP addresses (e.g., Microsoft Azure) could be indicative of **Command and Control (C2)** activity.
     - **Possible Attack Vector**: PowerShell might have been used to **download and execute payloads**, or even used for **fileless attacks**, where code is injected directly into memory without a file being written to disk. This could be crucial to investigate further, especially since PowerShell can manipulate memory, network, and file systems.

### 2. **SmartScreen (PID 8468)**
   - **File**: `executable.8468.exe`
   - **SHA-256**: `a5cf958d3d42458375f3e08c75f0c18968c5ee778cfa99463073dabfec14695e`
   - **Flagged by**: **SecureAge** (as malicious)
   - **Analysis**:
     - **SmartScreen.exe** is a **legitimate Windows process** that plays a key role in protecting systems by filtering malicious files and websites. However, in this case, the file was flagged as **malicious** by **SecureAge**, and the file signature was **not verified**. 
     - The creation time is suspicious, dated **1977**, which could suggest **timestamp forging**—a tactic often used to avoid detection and confuse investigators.
     - **Possible Attack Vector**: An attacker might have **replaced or tampered** with the legitimate `smartscreen.exe` process to bypass detection mechanisms, indicating this could be a **Trojanized version**. This also suggests persistence mechanisms could be in place via DLL injection or process hollowing.

### 3. **SmartScreen (PID 7956)**
   - **File**: `executable.7956.exe`
   - **SHA-256**: `f64d46ddc17f75ef753276ef5c61b438560b47b06fee300ebd72f3c4e6716594`
   - **Flagged by**: **SecureAge** (as malicious)
   - **Analysis**:
     - **Similar to PID 8468**, this `smartscreen.exe` file is flagged as malicious by **SecureAge**. The two processes (8468 and 7956) could be part of a **larger campaign**, with the attacker using multiple instances of the same executable for redundancy or different phases of the attack.
     - Like the previous instance, the **file signature** is **not verified**, and **timestamp manipulation** is evident, raising suspicions about its integrity.
     - **Possible Attack Vector**: This SmartScreen process could be used for **defense evasion**, allowing the malware to bypass security mechanisms and execute other processes without being detected.

### Summary of All Three Suspected PE Files

1. **PowerShell (PID 7592)**:
   - **SHA-256**: `21c335dac685f3e721235aafd163ffac8f74051970cefa7ae40330143e7dec96`
   - PowerShell is **flagged as malicious** and exhibits behaviors that suggest it is part of a **remote code execution** or **command and control** scheme.
   - **Suspected Attack Type**: Fileless attack or payload download.

2. **SmartScreen (PID 8468)**:
   - **SHA-256**: `a5cf958d3d42458375f3e08c75f0c18968c5ee778cfa99463073dabfec14695e`
   - SmartScreen.exe was **tampered with** or replaced by a **Trojan**. Its **timestamp is forged**, suggesting an attempt to hide its true origin.
   - **Suspected Attack Type**: Trojanized system component for persistence and defense evasion.

3. **SmartScreen (PID 7956)**:
   - **SHA-256**: `f64d46ddc17f75ef753276ef5c61b438560b47b06fee300ebd72f3c4e6716594`
   - Similar to PID 8468, this version of `smartscreen.exe` has also been tampered with. The presence of multiple SmartScreen processes suggests this is part of a **coordinated attack** aimed at bypassing detection.
   - **Suspected Attack Type**: Another Trojanized SmartScreen process used for persistence or to cover tracks.

---

### Investigation Context

These three processes—**PowerShell and two SmartScreen instances**—suggest a sophisticated attack that leverages **legitimate Windows components** to **stay under the radar**. The use of PowerShell indicates potential **remote execution**, while the tampering of SmartScreen.exe highlights **persistence** and **defense evasion techniques**.

From analyzing the **Edge-Internet Explorer 10-11 Main History** file, we can identify some key points surrounding the web activity relevant to the case. Below are important insights:

1. **Craig’s Activity** on 14th October 2019:
   - **Minesweeper Searches**: Craig visited multiple websites related to downloading Minesweeper games, including:
     - `http://play-minesweeper.com/` at 04:46 (play Minesweeper online)
     - Search queries like **"free minesweeper"** and **"play-minesweeper"**.
     - He then navigated to **Filebin.net** to download the suspicious **Minesweeperz.exe** file.
     - This activity is followed by access to **Minesweeper-related gaming sites**.
   
2. **Malware Delivery**:
   - Craig’s history shows access to **Filebin.net**, a file-sharing service, specifically the URL `https://filebin.net/qkzfz4ixazs73hb8/Minesweeperz.exe` which corresponds to the **Minesweeperz.exe** file we analyzed earlier.
   - The download time recorded was **04:25 AM** on **14/10/2019**.

3. **Microsoft Services Login**:
   - Craig also accessed **Microsoft login services** (e.g., `https://login.live.com`) between **04:29 and 04:30 AM**, suggesting possible synchronization or session management activity during this period.

4. **Other Non-Malicious Activities**:
   - Bob, another user, is recorded accessing various horse racing websites around the same time (from 04:16 to 04:19 on 14th October), unrelated to the malware, suggesting this is normal user behavior.

Yes, I have completed the analysis of the **Edge Cache Data**. Here's the detailed report based on the findings:

### **Edge Cache Data Analysis Report**

#### **Overview:**
The Edge Cache Data file provided has been analyzed to identify any suspicious activities, abnormal URL patterns, or potential signs of compromise. We focused on uncovering URLs, files, and activities that may have contributed to the infection and linked them to the observed system behavior.

#### **Key Findings:**

1. **Suspicious URLs:**
   - **URL Identified**: `https://filebin.net/qkzfz4ixazs73hb8/Minesweeperz.exe`
     - This URL was flagged during the analysis as a source from which a suspicious executable (`Minesweeperz.exe`) was downloaded. The cache data confirmed the presence of this URL, which correlates with other evidence of compromise related to this file.
     - **Significance**: This is directly tied to the initial infection vector, confirming that the user likely downloaded a malicious file from this URL, leading to further compromise.

2. **Potentially Malicious Websites Visited:**
   - **freeminesweeper.org**
   - **play-minesweeper.com**
   - **minesweeperonline.com**
     - These sites were visited prior to the download of `Minesweeperz.exe`. The presence of these sites in the cache indicates that the user was interacting with websites related to downloading or playing Minesweeper. These sites could either be compromised or serve as social engineering platforms to lure users into downloading malicious files.
     - **Significance**: The user visited these sites just before downloading the malicious executable, reinforcing the likelihood that this was part of the malware distribution chain.

3. **Browser Activity:**
   - The cache data shows **regular browsing activities** that might seem benign but could be connected to malware campaigns. The user interacted with several Minesweeper-related gaming sites, such as **freeminesweeper.org** and **minesweeperonline.com**, suggesting user interest in online gaming was exploited for malicious purposes.
   - **Significance**: The browsing activity aligns with other evidence of user behavior that contributed to the compromise.

4. **Downloaded Files:**
   - The cache also reveals records of the **Minesweeperz.exe** download, which corresponds with the malicious activity timeline. This file was downloaded, executed multiple times, and played a key role in compromising the system.

5. **Cookies and Session Data:**
   - Cookies related to **Google Analytics** and **Edge Cookies** from these gaming sites were found in the cache data. These cookies could potentially be used for tracking the user's activity and further exploiting the compromised system.
   - **Significance**: While these cookies are typically used for tracking purposes, their presence on a compromised machine suggests they could be used by attackers for surveillance or as part of a larger exploit.

#### **Conclusions:**
- The **Edge Cache Data** strongly supports the conclusion that the initial attack vector involved the user visiting several Minesweeper-related gaming websites and downloading the malicious **Minesweeperz.exe** file from the URL hosted on **filebin.net**.
- The timeline of events captured in the cache data aligns with the observed compromise, confirming that this was likely the initial entry point for the attacker.
- The cache data also provides insight into the user's behavior before and during the compromise, helping to piece together the attack's progression.

#### **Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **Examine PowerShell and Event Logs**:
   - Investigate PowerShell commands executed around the time the suspicious file was downloaded. This could reveal how the system was further compromised after the initial infection.
   
2. **Analyze Outbound Network Traffic**:
   - Inspect outbound connections to **filebin.net** and other suspicious domains to determine if there was any data exfiltration or ongoing Command-and-Control (C2) activity.

3. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**:
   - Focus on identifying persistence mechanisms using registry keys or scheduled tasks by further investigating the memory and registry for any hidden entries.

4. **Isolate and Analyze the Malicious Executable**:
   - Extract and analyze the **Minesweeperz.exe** file in a controlled environment to fully understand its behavior and payload.

This completes the **Edge Cache Data** analysis. If further actions are needed based on this report, we can continue investigating other artifacts in the system. Let me know what you would like to do next.
## `vagrant-shell.ps1` 

located 
```bash
victim_02.disk.raw - Partition 4 (Microsoft NTFS, 59.4 GB) Windows\tmp\vagrant-shell.ps1
victim_01.disk.raw - Partition 4 (Microsoft NTFS, 59.4 GB) Windows\tmp\vagrant-shell.ps1
```


The content of the `vagrant-shell.ps1` script you retrieved confirms that it is designed to **disable critical Windows Defender features**. This script systematically disables various security mechanisms of Windows Defender, including:

### Key Points from the Script:

1. **Disabling Real-Time Monitoring and Protection**:
   - **Set-MpPreference** commands disable real-time scanning, behavior monitoring, IOAV protection, email scanning, and archive scanning.
   - These settings are essential for the real-time detection and prevention of malware.

2. **Modifications to Windows Defender Settings via the Registry**:
   - The script ensures that these settings persist across reboots by writing values directly into the registry under **HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender**.
   - This registry-based persistence ensures that even if Windows Defender tries to reset itself, these policies will block its critical features from re-enabling.

3. **Disabling Scanning of Network and Mapped Drives**:
   - These commands prevent Defender from scanning network files and mapped drives, creating a blind spot where malware could reside undetected.

4. **Disabling Windows Defender’s ability to submit samples**:
   - Disabling sample submissions to Microsoft means that if a new malware strain is detected, it will not be sent for further analysis or blacklisting.

5. **Persistence and Registry Manipulation**:
   - The script ensures the above configurations persist by checking if the registry path exists and creating it if necessary. This step makes it harder for an admin to re-enable these settings without deep investigation and corrective actions.

### Malicious Intent:

- **Disabling Security Protections**: The sole purpose of this script is to cripple Windows Defender, preventing it from detecting or blocking malicious activities.
- **Persistence through Registry**: The script’s use of registry changes ensures that these disabling settings remain active, even after reboots or other typical recovery attempts.
- **Execution via PowerShell**: This script being repeatedly run with **ExecutionPolicy Bypass** makes it clear that the attacker is overriding default security controls to execute this script without interruptions.

```
From the Windows Timeline Activity, we can track user interactions across various accounts. The key findings from the activity, relevant to our investigation, include:

1. **Search for Minesweeper and Downloads**:
   - **Search for "free minesweeper"** occurred at 4:23:19 AM on 14/10/2019. Craig's user profile is associated with these searches.
   - At 4:26:37 AM, the user accessed **minesweeperonline.com**. A similar search pattern continues with **freeminesweeper.org** at 4:27:09 AM.
   
2. **Edge Browser Activity**:
   - **Craig's activity** around these searches reveals a Google search for "free minesweeper" and interactions with several minesweeper-related websites.
   - The Microsoft Edge browser shows Craig had **active sessions with Google searches**, including the final focused activity on **free minesweeper**, which spanned until **4:46:45 AM** on 14/10/2019. The timeline matches the **Minesweeperz.exe** download timestamp and execution data from earlier.

3. **Minesweeperz Execution**:
   - At **4:25:37 AM**, **PowerShell** was launched (likely indicating command execution after downloading the file). This matches the first recorded **Prefetch** entry and the execution data.

These activities are tightly bound to the **Minesweeperz.exe** malware execution and the timeline for the potential infection. The search and browser interactions, followed by immediate execution, reflect a sequence likely indicating user intent to download and launch the infected file.

#### Next step:
We should now **analyze any related PowerShell commands** executed at 4:25:37 AM (UTC). We can check if Craig's account was used to run commands related to this download or launch of **Minesweeperz.exe**. Retrieving command history from event logs or related artifacts can reveal what actions were taken right after the download.

   - **SHA-256**: `3b12becd8375613d34bcbb29cc0b22efbd9622e18eb2373d543e564c87d018cb`
   - **Flagged by**: 2/72 vendors (Ikarus and SecureAge) for **Trojan.Patched**.
   - **Comments**:
     - KERNELBASE.dll is a legitimate Windows component, but the detection of **Trojan.Patched** could indicate it has been altered or injected into by a malicious process.
     - Given that this is the DLL tied to **smartscreen.exe** (which is itself a security utility), a modification of this DLL could indicate it was leveraged in defense evasion tactics. The creation time (September 2073) is also highly anomalous, which raises concerns of tampering.
  
### 3. **KERNELBASE.dll** (Vic2 - smartscreen.exe - `0xffffb80b89a562c0`)
   - **SHA-256**: `a7e30276238c70c66cb9a4483ed6f54d122ba31c84243bc0fcd12503c61d670e`
   - **Flagged by**: 2/72 vendors (Ikarus, Google) for **Trojan.Patched**.
   - **Comments**:
     - This is another instance of **KERNELBASE.dll** being flagged for **Trojan.Patched**, much like the one in Vic1. This supports the possibility that both victims were affected by the same or a similar type of tampering with KERNELBASE.dll.
     - Further behavioral analysis would be required to see if this module is being used for persistence or system hooking.

### **Analysis in Context**:
- The detection of **Trojan.Patched** in **KERNELBASE.dll** files across both victims suggests potential system hooking or modification of critical system functions. Since **smartscreen.exe** is involved in both, it is possible that this executable is being exploited to evade detection or carry out other malicious activities under the guise of a legitimate process.
- The **ADVAPI32.dll** finding, though flagged, is less conclusive and needs to be monitored alongside the flagged smartscreen-related files.
  
To build on the log you've shared, let's add further insights from the packet captures, IP reputation analysis, and our examination of **TLS traffic**.

#### **Analysis:**
- **Historical Reports**: In the past, this IP has been associated with **DDoS attacks** and **outbound requests** containing suspicious patterns. The most recent report was from **nine months ago**.
  
- **Relevance**: While the current IP is largely whitelisted, the previous history of attacks raises some concerns about its past use for malicious activities. This IP may have been involved in **data exfiltration** or **C2 (Command and Control)** activity depending on what services were active during the time Minesweeperz.exe was running.

---

### **Log Record for IP Address: 172.217.167.67**

#### **Summary:**
- **IP Address**: 172.217.167.67
- **Owner**: Google LLC
- **ISP**: Google LLC (AS15169)
- **Location**: Sydney, New South Wales, Australia
- **Confidence of Abuse**: 0% (minimal abuse, detected by only one AV tool)
  
#### **Analysis:**
- **Previous Activity**: This IP is tied to Google's services and, in the past, was linked to **phishing** and **web spam** (with one report from one year ago). Although the IP is largely considered **clean**, any suspicious activity would be tied to specific services running under Google infrastructure (like **Google Cloud**).
  
- **Relevance**: Similar to the first IP, this address likely belongs to **Google's cloud services**. However, given the **phishing history** of this IP, it’s worth investigating further to see if any suspicious data flows occurred during the time Minesweeperz.exe ran.

---

### Conclusion:
These IP addresses are part of legitimate infrastructure (Microsoft and Google). However, the **117.18.232.240** IP shows some past malicious activity, and should be analyzed further in the context of possible **C2 traffic** or data transfers initiated by Minesweeperz.exe. For the next steps, logs and further traffic analysis will help solidify whether any of these IPs were used for malicious purposes.

Now that you have the log records, let me know if you want to proceed with analyzing **Victim 2's SRUM logs and Event logs** for process creation.
Here's the refined list of findings and analysis with the specific **Wireshark filters** used for each part of the investigation:

### 1. **Filter for HTTP or HTTPS download traffic:**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     http.request.uri contains "Minesweeperz.exe" || tls.handshake.extensions_server_name contains "filebin.net"
     ```
   - **Findings**: Multiple `TLS Client Hello` requests to `filebin.net` for downloading `Minesweeperz.exe`.
   - **Analysis**: Indicates automated or scripted attempts to download the malware right around the time of the initial compromise.

### 2. **Filter for traffic to Minesweeper-related domains:**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     http.host contains "freeminesweeper.org" || http.host contains "play-minesweeper.com" || http.host contains "minesweeperonline.com"
     ```
   - **Findings**: Extensive interactions with Minesweeper game-related domains.
   - **Analysis**: Potential social engineering vector; user behavior or malware-triggered redirections need further investigation.

### 3. **Filter for any PowerShell-related traffic:**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     http.user_agent contains "PowerShell"
     ```
   - **Findings**: No PowerShell-related network traffic detected, suggesting local script execution.
   - **Analysis**: Investigate local event logs for PowerShell execution details, as network filters showed no external communications.

### 4. **Filter for DNS queries for suspicious domains:**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     dns.qry.name contains "freeminesweeper.org" || dns.qry.name contains "filebin.net"
     ```
   - **Findings**: DNS queries confirmed for both `filebin.net` and `freeminesweeper.org`.
   - **Analysis**: Supports evidence of these domains being central to the malware's network activities and infection vector.

### 5. **Filter for large amounts of outbound traffic (potential data exfiltration):**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     ip.dst != <local_network_range> && tcp.len > 500
     ```
   - **Findings**: Large outbound traffic volumes detected, raising suspicions of data exfiltration.
   - **Analysis**: Deep dive into session content is necessary, potentially requiring decryption of TLS sessions to identify exfiltrated data.

### 6. **Filter for all external (non-local) traffic and common malware C2 ports:**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     ip.dst != <local_network_range> || tcp.port == 443 || tcp.port == 80
     ```
   - **Findings**: Heavy external traffic on typical C2 communication ports.
   - **Analysis**: Suggests potential C2 activities; identifying the external IPs involved could link back to C2 servers and networks.

### 7. **Interpretation of Highlighted Packets in Red and Black:**
   - **Red Packets** (typically TCP retransmissions) and **Black Packets** (regular traffic) did not have specific filters but are standard coloring in Wireshark indicating retransmissions and normal traffic, respectively.

### Recommendations for Further Actions:
1. **Deep Dive into Suspicious Traffic**: Analyze encrypted traffic for hidden data exchanges, especially for sessions marked with large data transfers.
2. **Investigate DNS Queries**: Match DNS queries with internal log files to determine if other devices also queried these domains.
3. **Session Analysis**: Examine session logs for anomalies in data volume, timing, or duration that could indicate malicious activity.
4. **Local PowerShell Log Review**: Since network traces of PowerShell were not found, local logs could provide evidence of script execution and objectives.

This structured approach will help in piecing together the full scope of the network compromise and guide further remediation and forensic steps.

The analysis of the HTTP traffic related to Minesweeper-related websites shows the following:

### HTTP Requests to Minesweeper-related Websites
1. **Initial Access**:
   - **Request**: `GET / HTTP/1.1`
   - **Time**: `2019-10-14 04:23:55.503147`
   - **Destination IP**: `159.203.227.72`
   - **Details**: This is the initial request to the homepage of a Minesweeper-related site.

2. **Resource Downloads**:
   - **Request**: `GET /minesweeper.min.css?v=1524360431 HTTP/1.1`
   - **Time**: `2019-10-14 04:23:55.799455`
   - **Destination IP**: `159.203.227.72`
   - **Details**: This request downloads a CSS file, indicating the page was likely fully rendered, suggesting active user interaction with the site.
   
   - **Request**: `GET /minesweeper.min.js?v=1524360431 HTTP/1.1`
   - **Time**: `2019-10-14 04:23:55.810645`
   - **Destination IP**: `159.203.227.72`
   - **Details**: A JavaScript file download, further supporting the active rendering of the page and possible execution of scripts.

3. **Additional Resource Requests**:
   - **Request**: `GET /app_store_badge.svg HTTP/1.1`
   - **Time**: `2019-10-14 04:23:56.074809`
   - **Destination IP**: `159.203.227.72`
   - **Details**: Request for an image file, part of typical web page assets, showing more detailed user engagement with the website.

   - **Request**: `GET /flag.png HTTP/1.1`
   - **Time**: `2019-10-14 04:23:56.076609`
   - **Destination IP**: `159.203.227.72`
   - **Details**: Another image request, completing the picture of a typical web browsing session to these gaming sites.

### Analysis and Next Steps:
- **Engagement Confirmation**: These logs confirm that the user actively engaged with Minesweeper-related sites, not merely landing on these pages but interacting in a manner that suggests genuine browsing or gameplay. This provides context to the browsing behavior prior to the malware download, which could be an essential aspect of understanding the attack vector if these sites were compromised or used malicious advertising.
  
- **Further Validation**: To connect this activity directly to the malware incident, correlate these site visits with the timing of the malware download attempts. Look for any subsequent requests to suspicious or unrelated sites that could indicate redirection or drive-by download attacks.

### 2. **Wireshark Filter Results**

   - **Filter: `ip.addr == 31.130.160.131 && tls.handshake.type == 11`**:
     - **Result**: 201 packets.
     - **Interpretation**: These packets indicate a TLS handshake involving the exchange of certificates between the local machine and IP `31.130.160.131`. This suggests encrypted communication between the victim and this potentially malicious server, likely indicating an established TLS session, which could be for command-and-control (C2) or exfiltration.

### 3. **Filter: `http.request.uri contains "Minesweeperz.exe" || dns.qry.name contains "filebin.net"`**
   - **Result**: 3 packets.
   - **Frame Example**:
     - Frame `70662` and `70673` show DNS queries to `filebin.net`, which returned the IP address `185.47.40.36`.
   - **Interpretation**: This DNS query indicates that the local machine resolved the `filebin.net` domain to the IP `185.47.40.36` around the time of the infection. This reinforces that `filebin.net` was likely involved in delivering `Minesweeperz.exe`, and the DNS query suggests this was a part of the infection process. 

   - **Analysis**: These DNS packets, along with the HTTP requests, could help establish a timeline of the infection, tying the download of the malware to the interaction with `filebin.net`. If `185.47.40.36` is found to be involved in malicious activity or hosting malware, this strengthens the case for the involvement of `filebin.net` in the infection chain.

### IP address 185.47.40.36, which corresponds to filebin.net
```bash
ip.addr == 185.47.40.36 && (http.request.uri contains "Minesweeperz.exe" || tls.handshake.extensions_server_name contains "filebin.net")
```
Excellent! From the results, we can see that there are **7 packets** of **TLS Client Hello** messages sent to the IP address **185.47.40.36**, which corresponds to `filebin.net`. This confirms a strong connection to this domain, supporting the evidence of malicious traffic tied to the **Minesweeperz.exe** download.

### What does this tell us?
1. **Client Hello (TLS Handshake)**: Each of these packets is part of a TLS handshake, indicating that the compromised system is attempting to establish a secure connection with `filebin.net`. 
2. **SNI (Server Name Indication)**: The packets show that the **Server Name Indication (SNI)** points directly to `filebin.net`, which aligns with the download of `Minesweeperz.exe` from this domain.
3. **Timing**: These communications happen **right after the DNS queries** for `filebin.net`, as seen in the previous analysis, further reinforcing that this domain is central to the compromise.



### Wireshark Filter
``bash
ip.addr == 31.130.160.131 && tls.handshake.type == 11
``
#### Locate Certificate in a Frame
The certificate is present in Frame under TLSv1.2 Record Layer: Handshake Protocol: Certificate.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2467adf1-a086-4a37-ae3b-bcf154626191)

1. **Right-click** on the highlighted row.
2. Choose **Export Selected Packet Bytes**.
3. Save it with the file extension **`.der`** (e.g., `certificate.der`).

This should capture the certificate data correctly. Then in Kali run the `openssl` command to decode the certificate:

```bash
openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.der -text -noout
```

You've successfully extracted and decoded the certificate. Here are the key details from the certificate:

### Key Details:
- **Version**: 3
- **Serial Number**: `02:84:f5:7f:46:7b:b1:f4:ed:58:49:ec:c6:c5:7f:ab`
- **Signature Algorithm**: `ecdsa-with-SHA384`
- **Issuer**: Empty (`O=`). This is unusual since the Issuer is typically the entity that issued the certificate.
- **Validity Period**:
  - **Not Before**: July 18, 2019
  - **Not After**: July 17, 2022
- **Subject**: Empty (`O=`), indicating the certificate's owner is not specified clearly.
- **Public Key**: RSA, 2048-bit
- **Key Usage**: Critical (Digital Signature, Key Encipherment)
- **Extended Key Usage**: TLS Web Server Authentication
- **Subject Alternative Name (SAN)**: No specific domain listed.

### Analysis:
1. **Empty Subject and Issuer**: Both the subject and issuer fields being empty (`O=`) are highly unusual for valid certificates. Legitimate certificates should contain identifying information for both the subject (owner) and the issuer (certificate authority). This could indicate either a misconfigured certificate or something suspicious.

2. **Signature Algorithm**: The use of `ecdsa-with-SHA384` is a strong algorithm, which is commonly seen in modern TLS communications.

3. **Public Key**: The RSA 2048-bit key is a common key length and widely used for secure web communications.

4. **Validity Period**: The certificate was valid between July 18, 2019, and July 17, 2022, which aligns with the timeframe of your captured traffic (October 2019). This suggests that the certificate was valid during the time of communication.

5. **Key Usage**: The certificate is designated for TLS Web Server Authentication, which means it was intended to be used for securing communications between a web server and a client.
## malfind

```bash
python C:\volatility\vol.py --plugins=C:\volatility\plugins -f "Z:\Assessment 4\Evidence\victim_01.memory\victim_01.memory.raw" --profile=Win10x64_17134 malfind > 'Z:\Assessment 4\Evidence\Volalilty\malfindVic1.txt'
```

The `malfind` outputs you've shared suggest signs of suspicious memory modifications and possibly injected code. Let's go through the findings for both reports:

### **Vic1 (`malfindVic1.pdf`)**:
- **Suspicious Processes**: The `malfind` plugin reveals memory regions within the `smartscreen.exe` (PID: 8468), `powershell.exe` (PID: 2288), and `powershell.exe` (PID: 7592) processes. All these processes have suspicious memory regions tagged with `VadS` and protection set to `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE`, which is a strong indicator of potential code injection or malware behavior.
- **Injected Code**: The memory regions display abnormal executable instructions, such as:
  - At address `0x29180320000` within `smartscreen.exe`, there's evidence of manipulation, as shown by instructions like `MOV`, `XCHG`, `ADD`, and conditional jumps. These patterns are often associated with injected shellcode or malicious payloads.
  - At address `0x1eb3f340000` in `powershell.exe` (PID 2288), similar irregularities are seen, with a mixture of basic `ADD`, `MOV`, and `JMP` operations, which are typical signs of malicious behavior.
- **Potential Malicious Code**: The frequent occurrence of `INT 3` instructions in the `smartscreen.exe` regions suggests breakpoints, which might indicate debugging or malicious exploitation techniques.

### **Vic2 (`malfindVic2.pdf`)**:
- **More Injected Code**: The same `smartscreen.exe` process (PID 7956) has been flagged again with several memory regions marked with `VadS` and `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` protections, raising suspicions. 
  - Addresses like `0x27fba270000` and `0x27fca360000` show similar injected code patterns. These include sequences of `JMP` instructions and interrupt calls (`INT 3`), typical of malicious code or shellcode behavior.
- **`SearchUI.exe` Process (PID 6236)**: Another process with similar suspicious memory alterations, particularly with addresses showing non-functional instruction sets (i.e., repeated `ADD` instructions without valid operand operations), hinting at possible exploitation or a form of memory corruption or tampering.

### **Context for the Investigation**:
Given the nature of these findings:
1. **PowerShell and SmartScreen Involvement**: The presence of `powershell.exe` and `smartscreen.exe` with altered memory regions is highly suspicious. PowerShell is frequently abused in attacks (such as fileless malware), while `smartscreen.exe` being modified suggests possible interference with the system's security measures.
2. **Memory Injection Techniques**: The `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` flag in combination with the VAD tags and executable code manipulation indicates that these processes likely had malicious code injected into them. The breakpoints (`INT 3`) and various `JMP` instructions point to common shellcode behavior or exploitation techniques being executed in memory.

### Recommendations:
- **Dump and Analyze Memory Regions**: I recommend dumping the suspicious memory regions using `procdump` for deeper analysis. Specifically, examine the sections with `VadS` and executable permissions for more context.
- **Further Timeline Analysis**: Revisit the timeline of these processes and compare with logs to identify when the injection or exploitation took place.
- **Cross-reference with IOC (Indicators of Compromise)**: Check if any known IOCs match the findings, especially regarding PowerShell-based attacks or SmartScreen exploitation.

Let me know if you'd like help with next steps like dumping these regions or correlating with other artifacts!
### Command Line Scan Log Analysis
```bash
python vol.py --profile=Win10x64_17134 -f "Z:\Assessment 4\Evidence\victim_01.memory\victim_01.memory.raw" cmdscan
```

The `cmdscan` command output from the memory images of Victim 1 and Victim 2 provides insights into the active processes and the commands run in the system at the time the memory dump was taken. Let’s break down the findings for each victim.

#### Victim 1 (`cmdlineVic1.pdf`)
- **Observed Active Processes**: The output shows numerous instances of `svchost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `smartscreen.exe`, and other common system processes. Notably, the following processes stand out:
  - **`powershell.exe`** (PID 2288, PID 7592): Powershell is a legitimate Windows process but is often abused by attackers for running malicious scripts.
  - **`smartscreen.exe`** (PID 8468): SmartScreen is a Windows Defender process, but given its involvement in the investigation (flagged by VirusTotal in previous scans), this requires closer scrutiny.

#### Red Flags:
- **Powershell Activity**: The presence of multiple PowerShell instances, particularly `PID 2288` and `PID 7592`, raises suspicions. PowerShell is often used by attackers to execute malicious scripts or download payloads. In the context of the investigation, these should be analyzed to check for potential abuse (e.g., malicious scripts or encoded commands).
  
- **Smartscreen.exe**: The flagged instance (PID 8468) shows SmartScreen being used. While this is a legitimate Windows process, the fact that it was flagged during VirusTotal scans and appears multiple times in the investigation logs suggests it might have been tampered with or replaced by malware.

#### Victim 2 (`cmdlineVic2.pdf`)
- **Observed Active Processes**: Similar to Victim 1, the output includes multiple instances of `svchost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `smartscreen.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. Of particular interest are:
  - **`powershell.exe`** (PID 7572, PID 8284): As with Victim 1, the presence of PowerShell processes raises concerns about potential misuse.
  - **`smartscreen.exe`** (PID 7956): Like in Victim 1, this process is flagged for investigation based on VirusTotal results and should be further analyzed.

#### Red Flags:
- **Multiple Powershell Processes**: Victim 2 also shows several PowerShell processes (`PID 7572`, `PID 8284`). These should be checked for any unusual behavior, such as executing encoded scripts or making suspicious network connections.
  
- **Smartscreen.exe**: The `smartscreen.exe` process (PID 7956) in Victim 2 has been flagged in VirusTotal as potentially malicious, similar to Victim 1. This warrants further investigation to determine if it has been compromised.
