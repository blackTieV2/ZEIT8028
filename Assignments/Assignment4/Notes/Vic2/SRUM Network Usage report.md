Upon reviewing the provided *SRUM Network Usage* report for *Vic2*, here are the key findings regarding potential compromise indicators:

### 1. **Suspicious Application Activity**
   - **Minesweeperz.exe**: An unusual application (*Minesweeperz.exe*) appears in the logs. Its presence raises concerns, especially because it doesn't seem to be a default system application and may indicate a potential unwanted or malicious executable. The application transferred **42,917 bytes received** and **5,491 bytes sent** on **14/10/2019**.
   - **High Volume Transfers**: Applications such as **DoSvc** (Delivery Optimization Service) appear to have moved significant amounts of data. On **14/10/2019**, this service transferred around **175,665,853 bytes received**, which could indicate a large file or patch being downloaded, but could also suggest data exfiltration if exploited.

### 2. **Unusual System Service Traffic**
   - **Windows Defender (WinDefend)**: Has registered minimal traffic in terms of received/sent bytes (e.g., **2,323 bytes sent, 5,161 bytes received on 14/10/2019 at 03:40:00**). Its low activity level could suggest tampering or ineffective defense mechanisms during key periods of interest.
   - **System (System)**: Continues to show significant traffic in various logs. For example, **682,143 bytes sent and 1,408,183 bytes received** during a session on **14/10/2019**. System-level traffic should be reviewed to ensure no unusual command and control communications or data leakage.

### 3. **Network Communication**
   - **CryptSvc** and **DiagTrack**: Both services logged multiple sessions, and their activities should be further examined. **DiagTrack**, specifically, sent and received notable amounts of data across multiple sessions, including over **208,848 bytes on 14/10/2019**.

### 4. **Suspicious Timestamp Entries**
   - There are records with future timestamps (e.g., *!!HOSTNAME.EXE!2073/01/24:21:25:24!*). Such anomalies in the logging system can indicate tampering or an attempt to hide malicious activity.

### 5. **Potential Exfiltration**
   - **DoSvc** (Delivery Optimization Service) shows extremely high data transfer volumes, particularly on **14/10/2019**, with **191,362 bytes sent** and over **27,479,144 bytes received**. While this could relate to legitimate update traffic, the volume and frequency suggest that it should be further analyzed to determine whether itâ€™s being leveraged for malicious purposes.
   
### 6. **Data Transfer Summary**
   - Several other common system services (e.g., **LicenseManager**, **wuauserv**, **wlidsvc**) appear in the logs, often with high data transfer volumes. For example, **wuauserv** transferred over **2,707,838 bytes** in one instance, which is high for a background service.

### Recommendations:
   - **Malware Analysis of Minesweeperz.exe**: This file appears suspicious and should be analyzed for indicators of compromise (IOC).
   - **Deep Packet Inspection for DoSvc**: Analyze the traffic related to **DoSvc** for signs of exfiltration or abnormal file sharing behavior.
   - **Review Anomalous Timestamps**: Investigate any unusual or future-dated timestamps for signs of log tampering or evasion techniques.
   - **System Traffic Analysis**: Monitor and review system services with unusually high traffic patterns, such as **CryptSvc**, **System**, and **DiagTrack**.

These findings should guide further investigation into how the **Vic2** system may have been compromised, with a focus on identifying malware or exfiltration activities.
