Based on the contents of the uploaded documents, I can summarize the findings from your **Malicious_Driver_Detection** YARA scan reports across three parts, and analyze these in the context of your ongoing investigation:

### **Summary of Malicious Driver Detection Findings**

The YARA rules applied in the scan were specifically designed to detect malicious behavior or indicators associated with driver-related operations in memory. Here are the key findings from each report, analyzed and compared with the context of the attack chain in your investigation.

#### **Malicious_Driver_Detection_Part1:**
- **No Red Flags Raised**:
  - There was no critical evidence or malicious detection found directly in this part. The report primarily outlines normal memory operation logs related to drivers, with no clear link to suspicious or anomalous behavior.

#### **Malicious_Driver_Detection_Part2:**
- **Process Associated with svchost.exe (PID 4536)**:
  - **Suspicious Driver-Like Operations**:
    - Multiple references to **DeviceIoControl**, **NtRIMEnableMonitorMappingForDevice**, and **NtRIMGetDeviceProperties**, all related to device control and driver management. These APIs are commonly leveraged by drivers to manage hardware interactions.
    - Detection occurred in memory regions tied to `svchost.exe`, a generic process that, when compromised, can be used by rootkits or malicious drivers to interact with system-level components.

    **Analysis:**
    - The appearance of these calls within `svchost.exe` is potentially suspicious, especially if this process was running outside its expected behavior or without the presence of legitimate driver interactions.
    - Given the scope of your investigation, these indicators suggest that a malicious driver might have been injected or hooked into the `svchost.exe` process, potentially as part of the later stages of infection after the deployment of tools like `Psexec` and network reconnaissance.

#### **Malicious_Driver_Detection_Part3:**
- **Process Associated with MicrosoftEdgeC (PID 2120)**:
  - **Suspicious Driver-Related APIs**:
    - Similar to the second part, **DeviceIoControl**, **NtOpenKey**, **NtSetValueKey**, and **NtFreeVirtualMemory** calls are found. These APIs are often linked to low-level system manipulation, which could include driver-related operations.
    - The fact that these occur in `MicrosoftEdgeC` (the Edge browser) is unusual, as this process typically should not be handling driver-like operations. This indicates a possible compromise where malware leveraged a driver to manipulate the browser or evade detection.
  
  - **Driver-Related Strings and APIs**:
    - Several calls like `GetModuleHandleExW`, `NtOpenThread`, and `NtOpenEvent` are identified, further suggesting that the malware might be using these functions to manipulate memory or threads within the system.
  
    **Analysis:**
    - The Edge browser’s interaction with driver-related functions is highly anomalous and raises a red flag. This suggests the malware may be utilizing browser processes to communicate or handle low-level device management tasks, such as sending data to compromised drivers or loading malicious components into memory via the browser.

### **Contextual Analysis with Investigation**

In the broader context of your ongoing investigation:

- **Injection into Legitimate Processes**:
  - The YARA scan detected suspicious memory activity involving both `svchost.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeC`. These processes are often targeted by rootkits or malware to run undetected, especially with injected drivers that might assist in disabling security measures or maintaining persistence.
  - The evidence aligns with the hypothesis that rootkits or malicious drivers were likely involved during the attack, leveraging legitimate system processes to hide their activity.

- **Driver Involvement in Persistence and Evasion**:
  - Based on the results, it’s likely that the attacker injected malicious drivers into key processes to maintain persistence across reboots and hide from traditional security solutions.
  - The behavior captured in memory around `svchost.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeC` strongly indicates that the attacker used these processes as part of their evasion tactics, allowing them to continue interacting with system components and potentially exfiltrating data.

### **Next Steps & Recommendations**
- **Deep Memory Forensics**: I recommend using advanced memory forensic tools, like Volatility’s `malfind` and `moddump` plugins, to extract and analyze the suspicious drivers or injected modules further.
- **Examine Driver Signing**: Check for the presence of unsigned or maliciously signed drivers in the system’s driver store, particularly in the context of those interacting with `svchost.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeC`.
- **Rootkit Detection Tools**: Use tools such as `GMER`, `ChkRootkit`, or `TDSSKiller` to scan for deeper rootkits or hidden drivers that may not have been fully exposed through YARA.

By correlating these findings with your network and file system forensics, you can further pinpoint how the attacker utilized malicious drivers to persist and evade detection.
