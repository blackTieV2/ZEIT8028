From the examination of the provided `APT_Rootkit_Detection.pdf`, we can see that YARA rule matches indicate potential malicious activity related to Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) rootkits. Key information extracted from the memory dump shows that multiple processes, including **System** (PID 4), **smss.exe** (PID 272), **csrss.exe** (PID 380), **wininit.exe** (PID 480), **lsass.exe** (PID 612), **services.exe** (PID 596), and **svchost.exe** (PID 720), were flagged by the `APT_Rootkit_Detection` rule due to the presence of suspicious system call hooks and ZwCreate* API invocations. These APIs are typically used by rootkits to manipulate low-level system functionality.

The following system calls were found within the context of these processes:
- **ZwCreateFile**
- **ZwSetInformation**
- **ZwCreateJobObject**
- **ZwSetIoCompletion**

These system calls can indicate attempts to modify system files, alter memory or job object states, and set information on process threads. This is consistent with rootkit behavior aiming to control the system at a deep level while hiding its activities from regular users or administrative tools.

### Reflags in the Report
1. **System Process (PID 4)** shows ZwCreateFile calls, which are common targets for rootkits that aim to hide or manipulate files on disk.
2. **Csrss.exe (PID 380)** and **Lsass.exe (PID 612)**, both critical Windows processes, are implicated, showing ZwSetInformation and ZwCreateIoCompletion calls. This may point to rootkit activity within these processes to maintain persistence or inject malicious code.

### Relevance to the Ongoing Investigation
Given the critical nature of the processes being compromised, the presence of these APT rootkit behaviors could be part of a deeper system compromise affecting Victim 1 and Victim 2. The rootkits may be providing the attacker with stealthy control over both machines, allowing them to execute commands, transfer files, or exfiltrate data undetected.

These findings suggest the need for further memory analysis to determine the full scope of the rootkitâ€™s influence, including checking for other injected processes or hidden files. A detailed investigation should also look at whether these processes have been modified or whether hooks have been placed to intercept and manipulate system calls, as indicated by the Zw* APIs being triggered.

In the context of your ongoing investigation:
- These rootkits could be responsible for persisting access or exfiltrating data from the compromised systems.
- Immediate actions should include isolating affected systems and conducting deeper scans with volatility and additional rootkit detection tools.

Further investigation into the specific role of these processes in maintaining persistence or aiding lateral movement within the network is recommended.
