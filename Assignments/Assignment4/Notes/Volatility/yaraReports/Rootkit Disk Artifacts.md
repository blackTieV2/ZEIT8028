### Rootkit Disk Artifacts YARA Report

---

#### **Overview**

The Rootkit Disk Artifacts YARA scan detected key rootkit-related artifacts across various processes on the compromised machines, notably `svchost.exe`, `MsMpEng.exe`, `smartscreen.exe`, and `SearchUI.exe`. These findings align with the indicators of compromise found in earlier stages of the investigation, where lateral movement and privilege escalation tactics were suspected.

#### **Notable Findings from the YARA Scan**

1. **`svchost.exe` Process Involvement:**
   - Multiple instances of `svchost.exe` were flagged by the YARA scan, specifically indicating manipulations in the Master Boot Record (MBR). For example:
     - **Partition table errors** and **missing operating system messages** were detected, consistent with MBR tampering techniques used by rootkits to gain low-level system control.
   - This aligns with the persistence methods suspected earlier in the investigation, where system manipulation and stealth techniques were employed to maintain control over the infected hosts (Victim 1 and Victim 2).

2. **MBR Manipulation:**
   - Several rootkit-related entries pointed to alterations in the **Master Boot Record (MBR)**. 
     - The scan results in both `svchost.exe` and `smartscreen.exe` suggest malicious tampering with system boot records.
     - **MBR tampering** is a common rootkit technique used to maintain persistence by modifying the initial stages of the boot process. 
   - In the context of the ongoing investigation, this explains the observed abnormal system behaviors, such as difficulty in completely removing the malware and the persistence of malicious processes after reboots.

3. **MsMpEng.exe Process (Windows Defender Engine)**
   - **MsMpEng.exe**, the Windows Defender process, was also flagged in the YARA report for rootkit-related activity. The presence of suspicious binaries or indicators within a legitimate process like `MsMpEng.exe` is indicative of **process injection** or **hijacking**â€”techniques often used to hide malware within trusted system processes.
   - Given that the attackers had disabled various security mechanisms (as noted in earlier findings), this suggests that `MsMpEng.exe` was likely used as a decoy or exploited by the rootkit to avoid detection by antivirus solutions like Windows Defender.

4. **`smartscreen.exe` Process - Tampered Security:**
   - The `smartscreen.exe` process, which is normally used by Windows to block malicious websites and files, was heavily implicated in the compromise.
     - **PID 7956** shows multiple occurrences of rootkit-related data manipulation, particularly in the MBR and partition tables. 
     - This is consistent with the attacker's efforts to subvert Windows' built-in security mechanisms (as noted earlier in the report) and maintain system-level access.
   - This correlates with earlier memory analysis, where injected code was found within `smartscreen.exe`, suggesting it had been compromised by the rootkit to evade detection and retain control.

5. **SearchUI.exe Process:**
   - The YARA scan flagged `SearchUI.exe` for containing hidden or tampered code related to **suggestion text and CSS classes**, potentially indicating a **GUI-based attack vector**.
     - Although less significant compared to the other processes, this could point to attempts to hijack the search functionality for espionage or data exfiltration.

#### **Link to the Investigation Findings**

The YARA scan results provide crucial insights that tie into several previously noted events in the ongoing investigation:

1. **MBR and Partition Table Manipulations:**
   - The MBR manipulation detected by YARA is critical, as it reinforces the suspicion that the attackers were using a rootkit to achieve low-level persistence on the compromised systems. This explains the consistent presence of malicious processes even after system reboots and security scans.
   - The YARA findings also suggest that the rootkit was used to bypass traditional detection methods by infecting critical system areas that are harder to monitor, such as the boot process.

2. **Tampering with Security Processes (MsMpEng.exe and smartscreen.exe):**
   - The scan's results indicating rootkit activity within `MsMpEng.exe` and `smartscreen.exe` validate the earlier conclusion that the attackers disabled Windows Defender and exploited its processes to hide their activities. 
   - The persistence of malicious behavior within `smartscreen.exe` aligns with the earlier detection of memory injections and the modification of security components, suggesting a deeply embedded rootkit designed to evade detection.

3. **Persistence Mechanisms and Privilege Escalation:**
   - The rootkit's manipulation of core system files and processes demonstrates a sophisticated approach to maintaining control over the compromised systems. These findings, when combined with the previously observed lateral movement (using `PsExec` and `A.exe`), suggest that the rootkit was part of a larger campaign to escalate privileges and move between systems undetected.

4. **Evidence of Defense Evasion and Persistence:**
   - The presence of rootkit-related data in the MBR, `MsMpEng.exe`, and `smartscreen.exe` suggests that the attackers not only gained system-level access but also took steps to **evade detection** by compromising system files that are typically trusted by Windows security measures.
   - These tactics explain why the attackers were able to persist on the network for an extended period without being flagged by traditional antivirus and endpoint protection tools.

### **Conclusion and Next Steps**

The YARA-based rootkit detection results reveal critical artifacts linking rootkit activity to the compromised hosts in this investigation. The presence of MBR tampering, along with the exploitation of core processes like `MsMpEng.exe` and `smartscreen.exe`, strongly indicates that a sophisticated rootkit was deployed to ensure persistence and evade detection.

**Recommendations:**
- **MBR Recovery:** Immediate steps should be taken to recover or restore the MBR using specialized tools, as this would help in removing the rootkit's influence from the boot process.
- **Deep Forensic Analysis of System Processes:** A deeper analysis of the flagged processes (`svchost.exe`, `MsMpEng.exe`, `smartscreen.exe`) should be conducted to extract any additional malware or rootkit components.
- **Endpoint Security Hardening:** Given the rootkit's ability to exploit system processes like Windows Defender, it is crucial to enhance endpoint security by implementing more robust monitoring of security processes and boot-level integrity checks.

These YARA results provide valuable evidence that links directly to the attackers' persistence mechanisms and supports the hypothesis of a sophisticated rootkit being at the core of this breach.
