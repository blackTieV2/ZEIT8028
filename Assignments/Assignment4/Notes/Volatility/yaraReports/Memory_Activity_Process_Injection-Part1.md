**Memory_Activity_Process_Injection** report, we can observe multiple instances of PowerShell processes (with PIDs like 7572 and 8284) showing signs of suspicious memory activities.
PowerShell references
### Key Findings:
1. **Suspicious Memory Behavior in PowerShell Processes**:
   - The PowerShell processes (notably with PIDs 7572 and 8284) exhibit patterns that include **memory injection activities**, marked by unusual code patterns and addresses indicating manipulated memory regions.
   - Several instructions within these memory regions suggest **code injection techniques** such as `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` permissions, which are typically used by malware to execute malicious code directly from memory.

2. **Injected Code Evidence**:
   - Code fragments associated with these PowerShell processes indicate irregular sequences (e.g., hex values and repeated patterns) often linked to **shellcode** or other injected payloads. This points toward potential **malicious code injections** leveraging PowerShell for fileless execution.

3. **PowerShell Execution in Context**:
   - Given that PowerShell is frequently exploited in post-exploitation phases (e.g., downloading payloads, executing commands remotely), the suspicious memory activity aligns with the ongoing investigation into possible rootkits and lateral movement across the compromised systems.

4. **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**:
   - The appearance of these memory injection techniques in PowerShell processes reinforces previous findings of PowerShell being utilized by attackers for **remote execution**, possibly in conjunction with lateral movement tools like PsExec and malicious binaries like `A.exe` or `Minesweeperz.exe`.

### Next Steps:
- **Memory Dump Analysis**: Dump the suspicious memory regions identified in PowerShell processes for deeper analysis to confirm the presence of malicious code.
- **Correlation with Other Evidence**: Cross-reference these PowerShell memory activities with other artifacts in the investigation, such as network traffic or disk artifacts, to identify further signs of attacker activity and persistence mechanisms.

The analysis suggests that PowerShell was likely used as part of the attack chain, possibly for **fileless execution** or for **running malicious scripts** within the compromised environment.

After thoroughly reviewing the "Memory_Activity_Process_Injection" documents provided, particularly those focusing on PowerShell and MicrosoftEdgeC processes, several notable patterns and potential red flags emerge. Here is a detailed analysis based on the contents of the files:

### Powershell Process (PID 7572 and 8284)
The PowerShell process in the captured memory activity displays several suspicious characteristics tied to potential exploitation and injection techniques. Some key observations include:

1. **Frequent Usage of Memory Allocation and Virtual Memory APIs**:
   - **VirtualAllocEx**, **VirtualProtect**, and **VirtualFree** are used extensively within the PowerShell process, specifically in allocating memory spaces and modifying permissions on allocated memory regions. These are typical behaviors associated with process injection techniques, especially when combined with PowerShell as the process of origin【166†source】【167†source】.
   - **HeapCreate** and **HeapDestroy** functions are also present, further supporting the suspicion of dynamic memory manipulation and possible memory corruption techniques being employed.

2. **Thread Management and Synchronization APIs**:
   - Functions like **SetThreadPriority**, **SwitchToThread**, and **ResumeThread** are seen, indicating the manipulation of thread priorities and possibly orchestrating parallel tasks. Manipulating threads and their execution can be used in stealthy malware, allowing injected code to run in the context of a legitimate process without raising immediate suspicion【167†source】.

3. **Environment and System Manipulation**:
   - Calls to **GetEnvironmentStringsW**, **FreeEnvironmentStringsW**, and **GetThreadPriority** indicate that the PowerShell process is possibly modifying or inspecting environment variables and thread states. These behaviors align with tactics used to identify system configurations or optimize malicious actions based on the environment.

4. **Evidence of Potential Code Injection**:
   - The presence of **DuplicateHandle** calls further strengthens the case for potential code injection techniques. **DuplicateHandle** is frequently leveraged by malware to duplicate handles in other processes, enabling control over target process execution【166†source】.
   - The activity seen around **VirtualAllocExNuma** and **SetWindowsHookEx** suggests cross-process memory sharing and hooks, which are commonly utilized in keylogging, injection attacks, or DLL hijacking.

5. **Execution and Injection Activity**:
   - The appearance of string references such as **TlgAggregateSummary** and **ErrorHandlingMessage** shows possible telemetry or error logging being intercepted or manipulated by injected code, indicating that the process might be exploited or altered through external code【167†source】.

### MicrosoftEdgeC Process (PID 6136)
The "MicrosoftEdgeC" process similarly showcases suspicious memory injection behavior:

1. **Virtual Memory Manipulation**:
   - Similar to the PowerShell process, the frequent invocation of **VirtualAllocEx**, **VirtualProtectEx**, and **SetWindowsHookEx** within the MicrosoftEdgeC process aligns with behaviors commonly associated with exploitation through process injection【166†source】.
   - **ReadProcessMemory** and **WriteProcessMemory** appear as well, which are pivotal in reading and writing to another process's memory space, a fundamental part of process hollowing or code injection【166†source】.

2. **String References and API Resolution**:
   - The document shows strings related to **api-ms-win-core-** DLLs, which are part of the Windows API set, indicating dynamic resolution or loading of APIs for core system functionalities. This could suggest either legitimate dynamic linking or, more concerningly, the usage of dynamically resolved APIs for malicious intent【166†source】.
   - **DelayLoadFailureHook** and **ResolveDelayLoadedAPI** could be associated with dynamic library injection or the evasion of traditional DLL loading mechanisms, often seen in advanced persistence techniques.

3. **SetWindowsHookEx**:
   - This API is noteworthy for its role in installing a hook procedure to monitor system events. When used maliciously, it can capture keystrokes, mouse movements, or inject code into other processes【166†source】.

### Conclusion and Potential Threats
Based on this analysis, both processes exhibit strong indicators of memory manipulation and potential injection techniques. The PowerShell process, especially, appears to be involved in advanced techniques such as:
- Cross-process memory manipulation,
- Thread and memory space control,
- API hooks and environment alterations,
- Potential remote code execution capabilities.

In combination with MicrosoftEdgeC’s activity, these behaviors point towards the possibility of an exploitation chain where PowerShell is used as a delivery mechanism for injected code into legitimate processes like Edge. The evidence strongly suggests malicious activity, especially around memory manipulation, environment inspection, and injected thread control.

It is highly recommended to:
1. Investigate further for any ongoing injection or persistence mechanisms.
2. Perform a full forensic analysis of the affected systems.
3. Look for related malware strains or rootkits based on the behavioral patterns observed.

This case warrants a high-priority investigation due to the sophisticated nature of the injection techniques and potential exploitation of core system processes.
