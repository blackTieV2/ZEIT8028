Here's the refined list of findings and analysis with the specific **Wireshark filters** used for each part of the investigation:

### 1. **Filter for HTTP or HTTPS download traffic:**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     http.request.uri contains "Minesweeperz.exe" || tls.handshake.extensions_server_name contains "filebin.net"
     ```
   - **Findings**: Multiple `TLS Client Hello` requests to `filebin.net` for downloading `Minesweeperz.exe`.
   - **Analysis**: Indicates automated or scripted attempts to download the malware right around the time of the initial compromise.

### 2. **Filter for traffic to Minesweeper-related domains:**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     http.host contains "freeminesweeper.org" || http.host contains "play-minesweeper.com" || http.host contains "minesweeperonline.com"
     ```
   - **Findings**: Extensive interactions with Minesweeper game-related domains.
   - **Analysis**: Potential social engineering vector; user behavior or malware-triggered redirections need further investigation.

### 3. **Filter for any PowerShell-related traffic:**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     http.user_agent contains "PowerShell"
     ```
   - **Findings**: No PowerShell-related network traffic detected, suggesting local script execution.
   - **Analysis**: Investigate local event logs for PowerShell execution details, as network filters showed no external communications.

### 4. **Filter for DNS queries for suspicious domains:**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     dns.qry.name contains "freeminesweeper.org" || dns.qry.name contains "filebin.net"
     ```
   - **Findings**: DNS queries confirmed for both `filebin.net` and `freeminesweeper.org`.
   - **Analysis**: Supports evidence of these domains being central to the malware's network activities and infection vector.

### 5. **Filter for large amounts of outbound traffic (potential data exfiltration):**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     ip.dst != <local_network_range> && tcp.len > 500
     ```
   - **Findings**: Large outbound traffic volumes detected, raising suspicions of data exfiltration.
   - **Analysis**: Deep dive into session content is necessary, potentially requiring decryption of TLS sessions to identify exfiltrated data.

### 6. **Filter for all external (non-local) traffic and common malware C2 ports:**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     ip.dst != <local_network_range> || tcp.port == 443 || tcp.port == 80
     ```
   - **Findings**: Heavy external traffic on typical C2 communication ports.
   - **Analysis**: Suggests potential C2 activities; identifying the external IPs involved could link back to C2 servers and networks.

### 7. **Interpretation of Highlighted Packets in Red and Black:**
   - **Red Packets** (typically TCP retransmissions) and **Black Packets** (regular traffic) did not have specific filters but are standard coloring in Wireshark indicating retransmissions and normal traffic, respectively.

### Recommendations for Further Actions:
1. **Deep Dive into Suspicious Traffic**: Analyze encrypted traffic for hidden data exchanges, especially for sessions marked with large data transfers.
2. **Investigate DNS Queries**: Match DNS queries with internal log files to determine if other devices also queried these domains.
3. **Session Analysis**: Examine session logs for anomalies in data volume, timing, or duration that could indicate malicious activity.
4. **Local PowerShell Log Review**: Since network traces of PowerShell were not found, local logs could provide evidence of script execution and objectives.

This structured approach will help in piecing together the full scope of the network compromise and guide further remediation and forensic steps.
