Here's the refined list of findings and analysis with the specific **Wireshark filters** used for each part of the investigation:

### 1. **Filter for HTTP or HTTPS download traffic:**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     http.request.uri contains "Minesweeperz.exe" || tls.handshake.extensions_server_name contains "filebin.net"
     ```
   - **Findings**: Multiple `TLS Client Hello` requests to `filebin.net` for downloading `Minesweeperz.exe`.
   - **Analysis**: Indicates automated or scripted attempts to download the malware right around the time of the initial compromise.

### 2. **Filter for traffic to Minesweeper-related domains:**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     http.host contains "freeminesweeper.org" || http.host contains "play-minesweeper.com" || http.host contains "minesweeperonline.com"
     ```
   - **Findings**: Extensive interactions with Minesweeper game-related domains.
   - **Analysis**: Potential social engineering vector; user behavior or malware-triggered redirections need further investigation.

### 3. **Filter for any PowerShell-related traffic:**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     http.user_agent contains "PowerShell"
     ```
   - **Findings**: No PowerShell-related network traffic detected, suggesting local script execution.
   - **Analysis**: Investigate local event logs for PowerShell execution details, as network filters showed no external communications.

### 4. **Filter for DNS queries for suspicious domains:**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     dns.qry.name contains "freeminesweeper.org" || dns.qry.name contains "filebin.net"
     ```
   - **Findings**: DNS queries confirmed for both `filebin.net` and `freeminesweeper.org`.
   - **Analysis**: Supports evidence of these domains being central to the malware's network activities and infection vector.

### 5. **Filter for large amounts of outbound traffic (potential data exfiltration):**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     ip.dst != <local_network_range> && tcp.len > 500
     ```
   - **Findings**: Large outbound traffic volumes detected, raising suspicions of data exfiltration.
   - **Analysis**: Deep dive into session content is necessary, potentially requiring decryption of TLS sessions to identify exfiltrated data.

### 6. **Filter for all external (non-local) traffic and common malware C2 ports:**
   - **Wireshark filter used**:
     ```bash
     ip.dst != <local_network_range> || tcp.port == 443 || tcp.port == 80
     ```
   - **Findings**: Heavy external traffic on typical C2 communication ports.
   - **Analysis**: Suggests potential C2 activities; identifying the external IPs involved could link back to C2 servers and networks.

### 7. **Interpretation of Highlighted Packets in Red and Black:**
   - **Red Packets** (typically TCP retransmissions) and **Black Packets** (regular traffic) did not have specific filters but are standard coloring in Wireshark indicating retransmissions and normal traffic, respectively.

### Recommendations for Further Actions:
1. **Deep Dive into Suspicious Traffic**: Analyze encrypted traffic for hidden data exchanges, especially for sessions marked with large data transfers.
2. **Investigate DNS Queries**: Match DNS queries with internal log files to determine if other devices also queried these domains.
3. **Session Analysis**: Examine session logs for anomalies in data volume, timing, or duration that could indicate malicious activity.
4. **Local PowerShell Log Review**: Since network traces of PowerShell were not found, local logs could provide evidence of script execution and objectives.

This structured approach will help in piecing together the full scope of the network compromise and guide further remediation and forensic steps.

The analysis of the HTTP traffic related to Minesweeper-related websites shows the following:

### HTTP Requests to Minesweeper-related Websites
1. **Initial Access**:
   - **Request**: `GET / HTTP/1.1`
   - **Time**: `2019-10-14 04:23:55.503147`
   - **Destination IP**: `159.203.227.72`
   - **Details**: This is the initial request to the homepage of a Minesweeper-related site.

2. **Resource Downloads**:
   - **Request**: `GET /minesweeper.min.css?v=1524360431 HTTP/1.1`
   - **Time**: `2019-10-14 04:23:55.799455`
   - **Destination IP**: `159.203.227.72`
   - **Details**: This request downloads a CSS file, indicating the page was likely fully rendered, suggesting active user interaction with the site.
   
   - **Request**: `GET /minesweeper.min.js?v=1524360431 HTTP/1.1`
   - **Time**: `2019-10-14 04:23:55.810645`
   - **Destination IP**: `159.203.227.72`
   - **Details**: A JavaScript file download, further supporting the active rendering of the page and possible execution of scripts.

3. **Additional Resource Requests**:
   - **Request**: `GET /app_store_badge.svg HTTP/1.1`
   - **Time**: `2019-10-14 04:23:56.074809`
   - **Destination IP**: `159.203.227.72`
   - **Details**: Request for an image file, part of typical web page assets, showing more detailed user engagement with the website.

   - **Request**: `GET /flag.png HTTP/1.1`
   - **Time**: `2019-10-14 04:23:56.076609`
   - **Destination IP**: `159.203.227.72`
   - **Details**: Another image request, completing the picture of a typical web browsing session to these gaming sites.

### Analysis and Next Steps:
- **Engagement Confirmation**: These logs confirm that the user actively engaged with Minesweeper-related sites, not merely landing on these pages but interacting in a manner that suggests genuine browsing or gameplay. This provides context to the browsing behavior prior to the malware download, which could be an essential aspect of understanding the attack vector if these sites were compromised or used malicious advertising.
  
- **Further Validation**: To connect this activity directly to the malware incident, correlate these site visits with the timing of the malware download attempts. Look for any subsequent requests to suspicious or unrelated sites that could indicate redirection or drive-by download attacks.

### 2. **Wireshark Filter Results**

   - **Filter: `ip.addr == 31.130.160.131 && tls.handshake.type == 11`**:
     - **Result**: 201 packets.
     - **Interpretation**: These packets indicate a TLS handshake involving the exchange of certificates between the local machine and IP `31.130.160.131`. This suggests encrypted communication between the victim and this potentially malicious server, likely indicating an established TLS session, which could be for command-and-control (C2) or exfiltration.

### 3. **Filter: `http.request.uri contains "Minesweeperz.exe" || dns.qry.name contains "filebin.net"`**
   - **Result**: 3 packets.
   - **Frame Example**:
     - Frame `70662` and `70673` show DNS queries to `filebin.net`, which returned the IP address `185.47.40.36`.
   - **Interpretation**: This DNS query indicates that the local machine resolved the `filebin.net` domain to the IP `185.47.40.36` around the time of the infection. This reinforces that `filebin.net` was likely involved in delivering `Minesweeperz.exe`, and the DNS query suggests this was a part of the infection process. 

   - **Analysis**: These DNS packets, along with the HTTP requests, could help establish a timeline of the infection, tying the download of the malware to the interaction with `filebin.net`. If `185.47.40.36` is found to be involved in malicious activity or hosting malware, this strengthens the case for the involvement of `filebin.net` in the infection chain.
