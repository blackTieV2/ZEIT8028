To build on the log you've shared, let's add further insights from the packet captures, IP reputation analysis, and our examination of **TLS traffic**.

### **Updated Log Report: Artifact - IP 185.47.40.36**

#### **Summary:**
- **IP Address**: 185.47.40.36
- **Owner**: Redpill Linpro AS (ISP based in Norway)
- **Associated Malicious Activity**: 
   - Phishing, Malware Hosting, and Email Spam (Historical)
   - Flagged as **Malware** by MalwareURL
- **Risk Assessment**: Moderate based on historical reports, though no recent abuse evidence (Confidence of Abuse: 0%).

#### **1. Network Activity Observed:**
- **Date of Network Activity**: 2019-10-14, spanning multiple TLS sessions from 04:25:01 to 04:27:26.
- **Total Packets Captured**: 4917 packets related to **TLS traffic**, of which **10 packets** were directly tied to **IP 185.47.40.36**.
- **Significant Packets**: 
  - Notable packet IDs: `70703`, `70704`, `70745`, `70808`, `81081`.

##### **TLS Communication Overview**:
1. **Encrypted Application Data** (Content Type 23):
   - A total of **TLSv1.2 encrypted data** was observed between **185.47.40.36** and **10.2.0.10**.
   - The sessions were encrypted using **ECDHE-RSA-AES-256-GCM-SHA384**. 
   - Multiple `Server Hello`, `Certificate`, `Server Key Exchange`, and `Encrypted Alerts` messages were exchanged, typical of an ongoing **TLS handshake** process.

2. **TLS Alerts and Unusual Session Termination**:
   - **Packet 70745** and **Packet 81081** indicate the use of **TLS Encrypted Alerts**. This often suggests unexpected session termination, which could imply an aborted connection or an issue with the encryption process.
   - These alerts may signal attempts to cover up or end the communication prematurely after data exchange.

#### **2. IP Reputation and Analysis**:
- **VirusTotal Report**:
   - **Flagged by 1/94 Security Vendors**: MalwareURL detected the IP as linked to malware, with most other vendors marking it clean.
- **AbuseIPDB Historical Report**:
   - Linked to **phishing** and **email spam**, but no recent activities reported. 
   - **Mudguts' report** from 2022-03-09 mentioned its involvement in a phishing campaign, linked to malicious URLs hosted on the server.

#### **3. Forensic Observations**:
1. **Potential Command-and-Control (C2) Activity**:
   - The TLS traffic, combined with historical reputation data, suggests that **185.47.40.36** could be hosting or associated with **C2 infrastructure**. The high volume of **encrypted traffic** exchanged rapidly (within seconds) aligns with patterns seen in malware communication for data exfiltration or control channels.

2. **Certificate Details**:
   - The **TLS certificate** presented by the server was issued by **Let's Encrypt** for `filebin.net`. While Let's Encrypt is commonly used for legitimate purposes, it is also favored by attackers for quick certificate issuance, allowing encryption in malicious campaigns.

#### **4. Recommendations**:
- **Investigate the Host System (`10.2.0.10`)**:
   - Correlate the TLS traffic timestamps (04:25:01 - 04:27:26 UTC) with process creation logs, registry changes, or any file modifications on the host. Look for unexpected programs or behaviors linked to network communication.

- **Review Internal DNS Logs**:
   - Check DNS queries made by `10.2.0.10` leading to connections with `185.47.40.36`. Malicious domains or unusual DNS queries (e.g., to file-sharing services like `filebin.net`) could provide further indicators.

- **Network Block and Monitor**:
   - **Block traffic** to and from IP **185.47.40.36**. Continue to monitor for any further attempts to connect to similar IPs or domains, particularly within the same ASN.

- **Decryption Attempts**:
   - If possible, decrypt the TLS traffic using known keys to analyze the exact nature of data exchanged. While encrypted traffic may obscure content, metadata or patterns (e.g., session durations, file transfer sizes) can provide clues.

- **Hunt for Persistence**:
   - Investigate for any persistence mechanisms deployed by the attacker to maintain access to the compromised host (e.g., scheduled tasks, startup items).

---

### **Next Steps**:
- **Host Review**: Focus on the system `10.2.0.10` during the observed traffic windows. Any malicious processes tied to the **TLS sessions** will help clarify the scope of the breach.
- **Expanded Network Analysis**: Look for additional outbound communications or lateral movement linked to other internal systems.

This updated log report expands on your initial findings with greater detail into the TLS handshake, alert signals, and potential implications regarding data exfiltration or C2 communications. Let me know if further packet analysis or host forensic investigation is needed!
