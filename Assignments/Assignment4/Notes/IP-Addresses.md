To build on the log you've shared, let's add further insights from the packet captures, IP reputation analysis, and our examination of **TLS traffic**.

### **Updated Log Report: Artifact - IP 185.47.40.36**

#### **Summary:**
- **IP Address**: 185.47.40.36
- **Owner**: Redpill Linpro AS (ISP based in Norway)
- **Associated Malicious Activity**: 
   - Phishing, Malware Hosting, and Email Spam (Historical)
   - Flagged as **Malware** by MalwareURL
- **Risk Assessment**: Moderate based on historical reports, though no recent abuse evidence (Confidence of Abuse: 0%).

#### **1. Network Activity Observed:**
- **Date of Network Activity**: 2019-10-14, spanning multiple TLS sessions from 04:25:01 to 04:27:26.
- **Total Packets Captured**: 4917 packets related to **TLS traffic**, of which **10 packets** were directly tied to **IP 185.47.40.36**.
- **Significant Packets**: 
  - Notable packet IDs: `70703`, `70704`, `70745`, `70808`, `81081`.

##### **TLS Communication Overview**:
1. **Encrypted Application Data** (Content Type 23):
   - A total of **TLSv1.2 encrypted data** was observed between **185.47.40.36** and **10.2.0.10**.
   - The sessions were encrypted using **ECDHE-RSA-AES-256-GCM-SHA384**. 
   - Multiple `Server Hello`, `Certificate`, `Server Key Exchange`, and `Encrypted Alerts` messages were exchanged, typical of an ongoing **TLS handshake** process.

2. **TLS Alerts and Unusual Session Termination**:
   - **Packet 70745** and **Packet 81081** indicate the use of **TLS Encrypted Alerts**. This often suggests unexpected session termination, which could imply an aborted connection or an issue with the encryption process.
   - These alerts may signal attempts to cover up or end the communication prematurely after data exchange.

#### **2. IP Reputation and Analysis**:
- **VirusTotal Report**:
   - **Flagged by 1/94 Security Vendors**: MalwareURL detected the IP as linked to malware, with most other vendors marking it clean.
- **AbuseIPDB Historical Report**:
   - Linked to **phishing** and **email spam**, but no recent activities reported. 
   - **Mudguts' report** from 2022-03-09 mentioned its involvement in a phishing campaign, linked to malicious URLs hosted on the server.

#### **3. Forensic Observations**:
1. **Potential Command-and-Control (C2) Activity**:
   - The TLS traffic, combined with historical reputation data, suggests that **185.47.40.36** could be hosting or associated with **C2 infrastructure**. The high volume of **encrypted traffic** exchanged rapidly (within seconds) aligns with patterns seen in malware communication for data exfiltration or control channels.

2. **Certificate Details**:
   - The **TLS certificate** presented by the server was issued by **Let's Encrypt** for `filebin.net`. While Let's Encrypt is commonly used for legitimate purposes, it is also favored by attackers for quick certificate issuance, allowing encryption in malicious campaigns.

#### **4. Recommendations**:
- **Investigate the Host System (`10.2.0.10`)**:
   - Correlate the TLS traffic timestamps (04:25:01 - 04:27:26 UTC) with process creation logs, registry changes, or any file modifications on the host. Look for unexpected programs or behaviors linked to network communication.

- **Review Internal DNS Logs**:
   - Check DNS queries made by `10.2.0.10` leading to connections with `185.47.40.36`. Malicious domains or unusual DNS queries (e.g., to file-sharing services like `filebin.net`) could provide further indicators.

- **Network Block and Monitor**:
   - **Block traffic** to and from IP **185.47.40.36**. Continue to monitor for any further attempts to connect to similar IPs or domains, particularly within the same ASN.

- **Decryption Attempts**:
   - If possible, decrypt the TLS traffic using known keys to analyze the exact nature of data exchanged. While encrypted traffic may obscure content, metadata or patterns (e.g., session durations, file transfer sizes) can provide clues.

- **Hunt for Persistence**:
   - Investigate for any persistence mechanisms deployed by the attacker to maintain access to the compromised host (e.g., scheduled tasks, startup items).

### **Next Steps**:
- **Host Review**: Focus on the system `10.2.0.10` during the observed traffic windows. Any malicious processes tied to the **TLS sessions** will help clarify the scope of the breach.
- **Expanded Network Analysis**: Look for additional outbound communications or lateral movement linked to other internal systems.

Here are the log records for the **three IP addresses** involved in the investigation based on their detection and analysis:

### **Log Record for IP Address: 52.229.207.60**

#### **Summary:**
- **IP Address**: 52.229.207.60
- **Owner**: Microsoft Corporation
- **ISP**: Microsoft Corporation (MSN-AS-BLOCK)
- **Location**: Hong Kong
- **Confidence of Abuse**: 0% (whitelisted, no abuse reports)
  
#### **Analysis:**
- This IP address is associated with **Microsoft Corporation's services** and shows no signs of malicious activity according to both **VirusTotal** and **AbuseIPDB** reports. The **zero detections** suggest that this IP is likely part of legitimate cloud hosting infrastructure (e.g., **Azure** or other Microsoft services).
  
- **Relevance**: Since it's a Microsoft-owned IP, it's possible that communication with this IP was part of standard system operations, updates, or cloud service interactions, rather than a direct indicator of compromise.

### **Log Record for IP Address: 117.18.232.240**

#### **Summary:**
- **IP Address**: 117.18.232.240
- **Owner**: EdgeCast Networks (Content Delivery Network)
- **ISP**: EdgeCast Networks (AS15133)
- **Location**: United States (Thousand Oaks, California)
- **Confidence of Abuse**: 0% (minimal abuse reports, considered **whitelisted**)
- **Abuse Reports**: Four reports between March 2021 and March 2023, linked to DDoS attacks and suspicious traffic.
  
#### **Analysis:**
- **Historical Reports**: In the past, this IP has been associated with **DDoS attacks** and **outbound requests** containing suspicious patterns. The most recent report was from **nine months ago**.
  
- **Relevance**: While the current IP is largely whitelisted, the previous history of attacks raises some concerns about its past use for malicious activities. This IP may have been involved in **data exfiltration** or **C2 (Command and Control)** activity depending on what services were active during the time Minesweeperz.exe was running.

### **Log Record for IP Address: 172.217.167.67**

#### **Summary:**
- **IP Address**: 172.217.167.67
- **Owner**: Google LLC
- **ISP**: Google LLC (AS15169)
- **Location**: Sydney, New South Wales, Australia
- **Confidence of Abuse**: 0% (minimal abuse, detected by only one AV tool)
  
#### **Analysis:**
- **Previous Activity**: This IP is tied to Google's services and, in the past, was linked to **phishing** and **web spam** (with one report from one year ago). Although the IP is largely considered **clean**, any suspicious activity would be tied to specific services running under Google infrastructure (like **Google Cloud**).
  
- **Relevance**: Similar to the first IP, this address likely belongs to **Google's cloud services**. However, given the **phishing history** of this IP, itâ€™s worth investigating further to see if any suspicious data flows occurred during the time Minesweeperz.exe ran.

---

### Conclusion:
These IP addresses are part of legitimate infrastructure (Microsoft and Google). However, the **117.18.232.240** IP shows some past malicious activity, and should be analyzed further in the context of possible **C2 traffic** or data transfers initiated by Minesweeperz.exe. For the next steps, logs and further traffic analysis will help solidify whether any of these IPs were used for malicious purposes.

Now that you have the log records, let me know if you want to proceed with analyzing **Victim 2's SRUM logs and Event logs** for process creation.
