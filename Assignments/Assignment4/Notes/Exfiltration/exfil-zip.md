## Details of Findings for `exfil.zip` from Autopsy

#### 1. **SAM and SYSTEM Files**:
   - **SAM File Header**:
     - **Hexadecimal Pattern**: `72 65 67 66 F4 00 00 00`
     - This indicates that the **SAM** file was likely part of a **Windows Registry Hive** file used to store account credentials and security information. The SAM (Security Account Manager) file is critical for storing user login data and can be used to extract password hashes, suggesting that the adversary likely intended to steal or manipulate credentials on the system.
   
   - **SYSTEM File Header**:
     - **Hexadecimal Pattern**: `72 65 67 66 2F 00 00 00`
     - Similar to the SAM file, the SYSTEM file is another critical part of the Windows registry, responsible for storing system-level information, including encryption keys required to decrypt the SAM hashes. The inclusion of both SAM and SYSTEM files in the ZIP indicates a likely attempt to gain access to credentials stored on the compromised system.

#### 2. **Artifact Findings:**
   - **$LogFile & $MFT Analysis**:
     - **$LogFile** entries show that the file `exfil.zip` was created and accessed on **2019-10-14 at 05:54:56 BST**. This coincides with other network traffic involving lateral movement and possible data exfiltration.
     - The presence of `exfil.zip` in both the **$LogFile** and **$MFT** confirms that this file was created during a session when a potential exfiltration attack was ongoing.
   
   - **$UsnJrnl Activity**:
     - The **$UsnJrnl** records show modification of the ZIP file during a significant period, aligning with the timeframe of lateral movement and network reconnaissance.

#### 3. **Potential Exfiltration Timeline**:
   - Based on the creation timestamp of **exfil.zip** and the presence of network artifacts showing possible data exfiltration or lateral movement, it seems likely that the ZIP file containing SAM and SYSTEM files was intended for **data exfiltration** or **credential theft**.
   
   - The adversary likely compressed these files and prepared them for transmission out of the network, which would explain the sudden spike in large encrypted data transfers observed in previous network traffic.

---

### Conclusion:

The files within `exfil.zip`, particularly SAM and SYSTEM, indicate that the attacker aimed to capture and steal sensitive user credential data, including password hashes. The timing of the creation of this ZIP file, alongside network events showing large data transfers, strongly supports the hypothesis that this was part of a coordinated exfiltration effort.

The next steps should involve verifying the network traffic logs for outgoing transfers during the period immediately following the creation of `exfil.zip` and correlating these with any potential external destinations involved in the exfiltration effort.

Let me know how you would like to proceed with deeper analysis.

#### **Evidence Context**:
- This artifact has been extracted from **exfil.zip**, which contains sensitive system files (e.g., SAM and SYSTEM) exfiltrated by the attacker. 
- The **password hashes** found are critical as they can be cracked to gain administrative or other account access to **Victim 2**'s system.
- The SAM file is part of the sensitive data exfiltrated by the attacker, indicating a potential **privilege escalation** or **data breach** attempt.

#### **Analysis**:
The presence of these password hashes in the **exfil.zip** file strongly suggests that the attacker targeted **Victim 2** for credential theft. These hashes could be subjected to cracking tools to reveal plaintext passwords, which would then allow unauthorized access to the compromised system. The extraction of such files from the victim's machine also demonstrates the potential for lateral movement within the network or persistence mechanisms, especially given the existence of the **SYSTEM** file, which often pairs with SAM for decryption purposes.

#### **Impact**:
- **Credential Theft**: The password hashes represent a serious security risk as they can be cracked to gain unauthorized access to various user accounts.
- **Potential Lateral Movement**: The attacker, once inside Victim 2’s system, could use these credentials to move laterally across the network or escalate privileges to an administrator.
- **Evidence of Exfiltration**: The **exfil.zip** file containing the SAM and SYSTEM files is direct evidence of data exfiltration, with the attacker potentially targeting high-value credentials.

---

#### **Next Steps**:
- **Password Hash Cracking**: Attempt cracking the identified hashes to ascertain the plaintext passwords for further investigation.
- **Correlate with SYSTEM File**: Cross-check the SYSTEM file from **exfil.zip** to fully understand the potential for decrypting these passwords.
- **Mitigation**: Immediately reset the passwords for the users listed in the artifact to prevent any further unauthorized access.
- **Monitor for Lateral Movement**: Investigate logs and network activity to determine if the compromised credentials were used for further exploitation or lateral movement.

---

This analysis links back to the broader investigation involving **exfil.zip**, where the attacker has extracted sensitive files from **Victim 2**. This artifact further indicates the attacker's intent to compromise system credentials as part of their operations.

2. **Key Details**:
   - **Password Requirements**: All accounts had passwords required.
   - **Disabled Accounts**: The default system accounts such as Administrator and Guest were disabled, which is typical.
   - **High-Privilege Users**: Most of the users in this artifact (e.g., Alan, Bob, Daryl, Eric) were part of the **Administrators** group, giving them elevated privileges on the system. These accounts are of particular interest for further investigation into potential lateral movement or data exfiltration activities.

3. **NTLM Hashes**:
   - Several NTLM hashes are listed for the accounts. These could potentially be cracked or used in pass-the-hash attacks if the environment allowed.
   - For example, the NTLM hash for **Bob** (`FC070F639673F2F91BDDB841150A2BFA`) and **Alan** (`8846F7EAEE8FB117AD06BDD830B7586C`) could be significant in understanding potential account compromises.

4. **Account Creation & Activity Dates**:
   - The accounts show activity around **14/10/2019**, which aligns with known suspicious activity in the timeline (such as the download and execution of **minesweeperz.exe** on Victim 1 and subsequent compromises on Victim 2).
   - The **WDAGUtilityAccount** shows an earlier last login of **10/10/2019**, which suggests system management activities prior to the full breach.

#### **Relevance to the Case**:
- The presence of user account details, particularly **high-privilege local accounts**, from **Victim 2’s system** within the **exfil.zip** strongly suggests that the attacker exfiltrated sensitive information, including SAM and SYSTEM files, indicating a full compromise of system credentials.
- By obtaining the SAM file, the attacker could have extracted NTLM hashes and attempted further lateral movement, possibly affecting **other victim machines** in the network, including Victim 1.

The **Shim Cache** artifact extracted from the source:

**Source**: `victim_02.disk.raw - Partition 4 (Microsoft NTFS, 59.4 GB) Windows\exfil.zip\SYSTEM`

provides crucial insight into the executed programs on **Victim 2**'s machine. Shim Cache (also known as the Application Compatibility Cache) stores information about executables that have been run on a system, which can help track any unauthorized or malicious activities.

### **Key Findings from Shim Cache Analysis:**

1. **Executed Files of Interest:**
    - Several executables were found, including `MsMpEng.exe` (Windows Defender), `AM_Delta.exe` (likely Windows Defender update), and `ssh-keygen.exe`. The presence of SSH-related files such as `ssh-keygen.exe` and `sshd.exe` on the system is unusual unless SSH services were intentionally set up, suggesting possible exploitation for remote access.
    - There is also evidence of potentially suspicious executables such as `sdelete64.exe` (used to securely delete files), indicating possible attempts to clean traces after malicious activity.

2. **Timestamp of Last Run Date/Time:**
    - Several executables, including `MpSigStub.exe` and `AM_Delta.exe`, show a last execution date of **14/10/2019** at approximately 3:40 AM. This correlates with the timeline where suspicious activity was suspected, potentially pointing to malicious software being updated or installed.

3. **Suspicious Temporary Files:**
    - Files such as `MpSigStub.exe` and `dismhost.exe` are located in **TEMP directories**, which is a common location for malware staging before being executed or moved elsewhere.

4. **Malware Artifacts:**
    - The presence of **sdelete64.exe** is particularly concerning as it can be used to securely delete files, likely an attempt by the attacker to cover tracks.

5. **Foothold Establishment:**
    - **sshd.exe** being executed suggests that the attacker may have set up an SSH server for persistent remote access on **Victim 2**'s machine, potentially linking to how the system was compromised.

### **Significance and Potential Link to Exfiltration:**
The presence of these executables and timestamps aligns with the hypothesis of **Victim 2** being compromised post-initial foothold. The timeline and files associated with **exfil.zip** extraction suggest that **Victim 2** was compromised through malware execution and remote access, likely facilitated by these SSH tools. Additionally, artifacts like **sdelete64.exe** indicate attempts to remove traces of activity, particularly after the extraction of sensitive data like **SAM** and **SYSTEM** files.

These findings strongly suggest that the attacker utilized the tools for lateral movement and to maintain persistence on the compromised system before exfiltrating critical system files.

This is another artifact extracted from the **exfil.zip** and is crucial to understanding the broader attack chain and how **Victim 2** was exploited.
