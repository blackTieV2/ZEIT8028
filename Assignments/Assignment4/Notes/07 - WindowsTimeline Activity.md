From the Windows Timeline Activity, we can track user interactions across various accounts. The key findings from the activity, relevant to our investigation, include:

1. **Search for Minesweeper and Downloads**:
   - **Search for "free minesweeper"** occurred at 4:23:19 AM on 14/10/2019. Craig's user profile is associated with these searches.
   - At 4:26:37 AM, the user accessed **minesweeperonline.com**. A similar search pattern continues with **freeminesweeper.org** at 4:27:09 AM.
   
2. **Edge Browser Activity**:
   - **Craig's activity** around these searches reveals a Google search for "free minesweeper" and interactions with several minesweeper-related websites.
   - The Microsoft Edge browser shows Craig had **active sessions with Google searches**, including the final focused activity on **free minesweeper**, which spanned until **4:46:45 AM** on 14/10/2019. The timeline matches the **Minesweeperz.exe** download timestamp and execution data from earlier.

3. **Minesweeperz Execution**:
   - At **4:25:37 AM**, **PowerShell** was launched (likely indicating command execution after downloading the file). This matches the first recorded **Prefetch** entry and the execution data.

These activities are tightly bound to the **Minesweeperz.exe** malware execution and the timeline for the potential infection. The search and browser interactions, followed by immediate execution, reflect a sequence likely indicating user intent to download and launch the infected file.

#### Next step:
We should now **analyze any related PowerShell commands** executed at 4:25:37 AM (UTC). We can check if Craig's account was used to run commands related to this download or launch of **Minesweeperz.exe**. Retrieving command history from event logs or related artifacts can reveal what actions were taken right after the download.
