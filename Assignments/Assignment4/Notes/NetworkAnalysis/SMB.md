### Detailed Report on Network Traffic (SMB) Between Victim 01 and Victim 02

**Artifact Overview:**
The network capture (PCAP) file was analyzed to identify potential lateral movement activities between Victim 01 and Victim 02 using SMB and other related protocols. The investigation was focused on SMB, which is often used for file sharing and can be leveraged by attackers for lateral movement within the network.

### Key Findings:

#### **SMB Traffic Between WORKSTATION01 and WORKSTATION02**
- **Date/Time**: October 14, 2019, between 04:23:02 AM and 04:49:36 AM UTC.
- **Hosts Involved**: 
  - **WORKSTATION01**: 10.2.0.10.
  - **WORKSTATION02**: 10.2.0.3.
  
- **Protocol**: SMB (Server Message Block Protocol).
- **Traffic Type**: NetBIOS Direct Group Datagram over SMB protocol.
- **Operation**: Regular **Host Announcements** and **MailSlot transactions**.

#### **Network Traffic Patterns**:
- **Host Announcements**: 
  - **WORKSTATION02** made periodic Host Announcements using SMB on UDP port 138 to the broadcast address (10.2.0.255).
  - **WORKSTATION01** also made periodic Host Announcements.
  - These announcements were broadcasted using the **NetBIOS Datagram Service**.
  
- **SMB MailSlot Operations**: 
  - SMB MailSlot transactions were observed between the two machines.
  - MailSlot messages such as `\MAILSLOT\BROWSE` were sent to **WORKGROUP**, indicating browser announcements and potential file sharing or resource discovery activity.

- **No Clear Indicators of Lateral Movement**:
  - While the SMB traffic between the two machines was consistent with typical network browsing and resource discovery, no clear malicious activity or unauthorized SMB sessions were observed in this set of network logs.
  - No signs of file transfer or direct file-sharing commands (e.g., SMB read or write requests) were found.

### Evidence and Offsets:
- **Frame Number**: 
  - **61703** (First Host Announcement from WORKSTATION02).
  - **73722** (First Host Announcement from WORKSTATION01).
- **Capture Length**: 243 bytes for each relevant packet.
- **Timestamps**: 
  - **Oct 14, 2019, 04:23:02 AM UTC** (Start of the SMB communications).
  - **Oct 14, 2019, 04:49:36 AM UTC** (End of the captured SMB traffic).

### Analysis:

- **Host Announcements**: The SMB traffic mostly consists of **Host Announcements** from both WORKSTATION01 and WORKSTATION02. These are part of the normal network discovery and browsing process and don't show direct signs of lateral movement or credential usage.
  
- **SMB MailSlot Protocol**: The presence of MailSlot traffic indicates basic network resource discovery, but no concrete evidence of lateral movement via SMB (e.g., unauthorized access or credential usage) has been found in this capture. However, MailSlot transactions could still be part of an attackerâ€™s reconnaissance phase.

- **Lack of Direct Evidence of Lateral Movement**: The filtered traffic does not contain evidence of file transfer or service-level interactions over SMB that would indicate lateral movement between Victim 01 and Victim 02. Further analysis of other protocols, logs, or malware artifacts may be necessary to identify the exact method of lateral movement.

### Next Step:
We should now **review memory artifacts** from both Victim 01 and Victim 02 to investigate further if any SMB or RDP sessions were initiated during this timeframe. Let's proceed with running **Volatility** on both victim memory images to extract process and network connection information.

Upload the relevant memory images, and I'll guide you through the next analysis steps.
