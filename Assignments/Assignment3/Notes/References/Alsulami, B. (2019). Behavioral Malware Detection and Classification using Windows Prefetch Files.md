### Abstract:
This dissertation by Bander Alsulami explores a novel approach to malware detection and classification through behavioral analysis using Windows Prefetch files. Traditional static malware detection methods are becoming increasingly ineffective due to the rise of polymorphic and metamorphic malware, which can alter their code signatures to evade detection. In contrast, behavioral analysis focuses on the execution characteristics of malware, making it more resilient against such evasive techniques. The dissertation introduces a framework for detecting and classifying malware based on dynamic features extracted from Prefetch files, which track application behavior during startup. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's accuracy, adaptability, and resilience, making it a significant advancement in the field of malware detection.

### Introduction:
The introduction of the dissertation emphasizes the growing threat of sophisticated malware and the limitations of traditional static detection methods. Alsulami introduces behavioral malware analysis as a necessary evolution in the field, capable of overcoming the shortcomings of static signature-based techniques. The dissertation aims to develop a malware detection and classification system that utilizes the dynamic data stored in Windows Prefetch files, offering an alternative approach that is both adaptable to new malware and resistant to evasion tactics.

### Definitions of Technical Terms:
- **Behavioral Malware Analysis:** The process of detecting and classifying malware based on the behavior of programs during execution, rather than relying on static code signatures.
- **Prefetch Files:** System-generated artifacts in Windows that contain data about the loading and execution of applications, which can be used to infer application behavior.
- **Polymorphic and Metamorphic Malware:** Types of malware that change their code or appearance each time they replicate, making traditional signature-based detection methods less effective.

### Summary of Key Concepts:
- **Windows Prefetch Files as Forensic Artifacts:** The dissertation highlights the forensic value of Prefetch files, which are automatically generated by Windows to speed up the boot and application load times. These files capture a wealth of behavioral data, including the sequence of files accessed by an application, which can be used to detect and classify malware.
- **Behavioral Detection and Classification Framework:** Alsulami introduces a framework that uses machine learning techniques to analyze Prefetch files for behavioral patterns indicative of malware. This approach is particularly effective against malware that evades detection by altering its code, as the behavior during execution remains consistent.

### Important Relationships Between Concepts:
The dissertation draws a crucial connection between the behavioral patterns recorded in Prefetch files and the ability to detect and classify malware. By focusing on the sequence of accessed files and other dynamic features, Alsulami's framework can identify malicious behavior even in cases where traditional methods would fail. This relationship underlines the importance of behavioral analysis in modern cybersecurity.

### Critical Theories and Frameworks:
- **Machine Learning in Malware Detection:** The dissertation leverages various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to analyze the behavioral data from Prefetch files. These models are trained to recognize patterns that distinguish benign applications from malware.
- **Adversarial Training:** Alsulami incorporates adversarial training techniques to make the detection framework more resilient against malware that attempts to mimic the behavior of legitimate applications to avoid detection.

### Methodology:
The research involves a comprehensive experimental setup where malware and benign applications are executed in a controlled environment. The Prefetch files generated during these executions are collected and analyzed to extract features. These features are then used to train and test various machine learning models, assessing their accuracy, adaptability, and resilience against evasion tactics. The experiments are designed to simulate real-world conditions, ensuring that the findings are applicable in practical scenarios.

### Structure:
The dissertation is well-structured, beginning with an introduction to the problem of malware detection and the limitations of current methods. It then progresses through a detailed explanation of Prefetch files and their forensic significance, the development of the detection and classification framework, the experimental setup, and finally, the evaluation of the framework's performance.

### Function:
The primary function of this dissertation is to propose and validate a new method for detecting and classifying malware based on behavioral data extracted from Windows Prefetch files. By focusing on the dynamic behavior of applications, this method offers a more robust approach to malware detection that is less susceptible to the evasion tactics used by modern malware.

### Suitability and Strength:
The dissertation is highly suitable for cybersecurity professionals and researchers, particularly those focused on malware detection and digital forensics. Its strength lies in its innovative use of Prefetch files and the integration of machine learning techniques to enhance detection accuracy and resilience. The thorough experimental validation further reinforces the practical applicability of the proposed framework.

### Conclusion:
Alsulami concludes that behavioral analysis using Windows Prefetch files is a powerful tool for malware detection and classification. The proposed framework demonstrates high accuracy in detecting and classifying malware, even in the face of evasion tactics. The dissertation suggests that future work could focus on expanding the framework to cover other types of dynamic features and further improving its adaptability and resilience.

### Discussion:
This dissertation makes a significant contribution to the field of malware detection by introducing a novel approach that leverages the behavioral data recorded in Windows Prefetch files. The research addresses the growing challenge of detecting sophisticated malware that can evade traditional static detection methods. The integration of machine learning models, particularly in a way that accounts for adversarial behavior, positions this work as a forward-thinking solution in cybersecurity. Future research could build on this foundation by exploring additional data sources and refining the machine learning techniques used.
