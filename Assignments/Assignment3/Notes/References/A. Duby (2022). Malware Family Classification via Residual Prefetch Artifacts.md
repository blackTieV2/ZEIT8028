### Abstract:
This paper introduces a novel approach to malware classification using residual Prefetch artifacts from Windows operating systems. The method focuses on cases where the original malware sample is unavailable, often due to self-deletion by the malware. By extracting features from Windows Prefetch files, which persist after the application’s deletion, the authors propose a method to classify malware into known families using Jaccard similarity and a set-theoretic approach that enforces semantic preservation constraints. The research demonstrates that this method can accurately classify malware, providing a valuable tool for forensic analysts in scenarios where traditional malware analysis techniques are insufficient.

### Introduction:
The paper begins by addressing the challenges faced in forensic malware analysis, particularly when the malware in question self-deletes after execution. Traditional malware classification techniques often rely on the availability of the malware sample to extract features for comparison against known malware families. However, in cases where the malware is absent, analysts must rely on residual artifacts, such as network logs or file system remnants. The authors propose leveraging Windows Prefetch files, which are automatically generated by the OS after the first execution of an application, to classify malware into known families. Prefetch files contain data about loaded libraries and process dependencies, which can provide insight into the malware’s behavior even after the executable has been deleted.

### Definitions of Technical Terms:
- **Prefetch File:** A system-generated artifact in Windows that records information about an application’s execution, including loaded libraries and dependencies, to optimize future runs.
- **Jaccard Similarity:** A statistical measure used to calculate the similarity between two sets, defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sets.
- **Semantic Preservation Constraint:** A rule ensuring that the core features of a malware family are retained across all instances, preventing classification errors due to missing essential features.

### Summary of Key Concepts:
- **Malware Family Classification:** The process of categorizing unknown malware into a known family based on shared behavioral and structural characteristics.
- **Feature Extraction from Prefetch Files:** The study extracts features related to the libraries and dependencies loaded during the execution of malware. These features are then used to classify the malware into a family, even if the executable itself is no longer available.
- **Set-Theoretic Classification:** The authors introduce a set-theoretic method that applies a semantic preservation filter, ensuring that only malware families with a minimum common feature set are considered in the classification process.

### Important Relationships Between Concepts:
The paper highlights the relationship between the extracted features from Prefetch files and their role in accurately classifying malware. By focusing on the commonalities within a malware family, the authors ensure that the classification method maintains a high degree of accuracy, even when certain features are missing or altered due to the self-deletion behavior of the malware. The use of Jaccard similarity in conjunction with semantic preservation constraints allows for a more refined and reliable classification process.

### Critical Theories and Frameworks:
- **Malware Classification Framework:** The study builds on existing malware classification techniques by incorporating Prefetch file analysis, providing an alternative method for situations where traditional analysis is not feasible.
- **Forensic Artifact Utilization:** The approach leverages the persistence of Prefetch files in the absence of the original malware, expanding the scope of digital forensics in identifying and categorizing malware threats.

### Methodology:
The authors executed 4,126 malware samples from 48 different families in a controlled Windows 10 environment, extracting the associated Prefetch files. They then applied a classification process based on Jaccard similarity, combined with a semantic preservation filter to identify the correct malware family. The dataset was divided into training (75%) and testing (25%) sets to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method.

### Structure:
The paper is structured to first introduce the challenges and background of malware classification, followed by the methodology of extracting and analyzing Prefetch files. The core of the study revolves around the classification approach, which includes a detailed explanation of the feature extraction process, the application of Jaccard similarity, and the implementation of semantic preservation constraints. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the method’s effectiveness and its potential implications for digital forensic investigations.

### Function:
The primary function of this research is to provide a reliable method for malware classification in scenarios where the original malware sample is unavailable. By utilizing Prefetch files, the study offers a way to extract meaningful data that can be used to classify malware into known families, enhancing the capabilities of forensic analysts in dealing with complex and evasive threats.

### Suitability and Strength:
The paper is highly suitable for the field of digital forensics, particularly in contexts where traditional malware analysis is hampered by the absence of the malware sample. The strength of the study lies in its innovative use of Prefetch files and the combination of Jaccard similarity with semantic preservation constraints, which together provide a robust classification method with high accuracy.

### Conclusion:
The study concludes that the proposed method for malware family classification via residual Prefetch artifacts is both effective and practical for forensic analysis. The results show that the method achieves high accuracy (F-Score between 0.80 and 0.82), making it a valuable tool for analysts in scenarios where the malware sample is no longer available. The authors suggest that future work could explore further optimization of the feature extraction process and the potential integration of this method with other forensic analysis tools.

### Discussion:
The implications of this research are significant for the field of digital forensics, as it offers a viable solution to a common problem faced by analysts—classifying malware in the absence of the executable. The study demonstrates the importance of considering residual artifacts, such as Prefetch files, in forensic investigations and highlights the need for continuous innovation in forensic methodologies to keep pace with evolving malware behaviors. Future research could expand on this work by exploring additional types of residual artifacts and their potential applications in malware classification.
