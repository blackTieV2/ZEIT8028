### Abstract: 
This paper addresses the challenges faced by cyber forensic investigators in identifying and recovering traces of malware on Windows systems, especially when anti-forensic techniques are used to delete or obscure evidence. The authors present methodologies for both live and offline forensics to extract critical information from various Windows artifacts, even after the malware has been deleted. The study emphasizes the importance of memory and storage media analysis, offering a detailed examination of Windows 10 artifacts like Prefetch files, ShimCache, and MFT records. The paper includes experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques in recovering traces of malware.

### Introduction:
The introduction defines cyber forensics as the science of acquiring, analyzing, and preserving digital evidence from computing devices. The authors distinguish between live forensics, which captures volatile data from an active system, and offline forensics, which focuses on non-volatile data stored on a computer’s hard drive. The paper highlights the increasing complexity of cybercrimes, where criminals often use malware to control victim systems and delete evidence. It emphasizes the necessity of retrieving evidence from both memory and storage media to build a complete picture of the suspicious activity.

### Definitions of Technical Terms:
- **Live Forensics:** The process of capturing data from a running system, focusing on volatile data like RAM content, which is lost when the system is powered off.
- **Offline Forensics:** The analysis of non-volatile data stored on a system’s hard drive, such as logs, files, and system artifacts.
- **Memory-Resident Malware:** Malware that operates primarily in a system’s RAM, leaving little to no footprint on the hard drive.

### Summary of Key Concepts:
- **Memory Forensics:** The paper emphasizes the importance of analyzing RAM to discover traces of malware, especially for memory-resident malware that doesn’t leave evidence on the hard drive. Techniques include analyzing kernel data structures, such as the Executive Process (EProcess) and Process Environment Block (PEB), to recover details about running or recently executed processes.
- **Offline Forensics:** The study details methods for recovering data from various Windows artifacts, including Prefetch files, ShimCache, and MFT records. These artifacts store critical information such as program names, execution times, and file paths, which can be crucial for tracking down and reconstructing deleted malware.

### Important Relationships Between Concepts:
The paper underscores the relationship between live and offline forensics in providing a comprehensive approach to cyber forensics. While live forensics is vital for capturing volatile data from RAM, offline forensics complements it by recovering data from persistent storage. Together, these methodologies allow investigators to reconstruct the actions of malware, even when attempts have been made to delete or obscure its presence.

### Critical Theories and Frameworks:
- **Forensic Artifact Analysis Framework:** The authors propose a framework for identifying and analyzing various Windows artifacts that may contain traces of malware. This includes analyzing RAM for live forensics and focusing on key artifacts like Prefetch files, ShimCache, and MFT records for offline forensics.
- **Anti-Forensic Techniques:** The paper discusses how anti-forensic methods, such as the deliberate deletion or manipulation of evidence by malware, complicate forensic investigations. It emphasizes the need for robust forensic techniques to overcome these challenges.

### Methodology:
The paper presents a detailed methodology for both live and offline forensic analysis. It describes the process of capturing a RAM dump for live forensics and the use of tools to analyze the EProcess and PEB structures to extract information about running processes. For offline forensics, the study outlines the analysis of various artifacts such as Prefetch files, ShimCache, and MFT records to recover information about recently executed or deleted programs. The authors also conducted experiments on Windows 10 systems to validate the effectiveness of these methods.

### Structure:
The paper is structured to first introduce the challenges and importance of cyber forensics, followed by a detailed explanation of the methodologies for live and offline forensic analysis. The core sections discuss specific Windows artifacts that are useful in recovering traces of malware, and the paper concludes with experimental results and discussions on the challenges and future directions of malware forensics.

### Function:
The primary function of this research is to provide forensic investigators with practical methodologies for recovering traces of malware on Windows systems, even when anti-forensic techniques have been employed. The study serves as a guide for identifying and analyzing key forensic artifacts, ensuring that critical evidence can be retrieved and analyzed effectively.

### Suitability and Strength:
The paper is highly relevant to the field of cyber forensics, particularly in the context of Windows systems. Its strength lies in the comprehensive approach to both live and offline forensics, providing detailed methodologies that are validated through experiments. The inclusion of practical tools and techniques makes the research applicable to real-world forensic investigations.

### Conclusion:
The study concludes that both live and offline forensics are essential for discovering traces of malware on Windows systems. The methodologies presented allow investigators to recover evidence from memory and storage media, even when anti-forensic techniques have been used to delete or obscure data. The authors suggest that future research should focus on improving the accuracy and efficiency of these forensic techniques, particularly in the face of evolving malware threats.

### Discussion:
The implications of this research are significant for cyber forensics, particularly in investigations where evidence has been deliberately deleted or hidden by malware. The study highlights the importance of understanding and utilizing various Windows artifacts to recover traces of malicious activity. Future research could explore the automation of these forensic processes and the development of more advanced tools for analyzing complex malware behaviors.
