### Structure for the Assignment:

#### 1. **Title Page**
   - Include the title of your report, your name, course, and date.

#### 2. **Abstract (~300 words)**
   - Summarize the purpose of your research, linking it to your recent investigation.
   - Mention how Prefetch analysis contributed to key findings in your investigation.
   - Highlight the significance of Prefetch files in forensic investigations.

#### 3. **Introduction (~400 words)**
   - **Introduce the Prefetch Artefact:**
     - Provide a general overview of Prefetch files, explaining their role in Windows operating systems.
     - Discuss why Prefetch files are important in forensic investigations, specifically in establishing program execution timelines.
   - **Link to Recent Investigation:**
     - Briefly mention how Prefetch analysis was pivotal in your investigation, particularly in determining when specific programs were run on Jean's computer.
     - State the goals of your report, including both a detailed technical analysis and a discussion of the practical applications of Prefetch files based on your investigation.

#### 4. **Technical Analysis (~2000 words)**
   - **4.1. Overview of Prefetch Files**
     - **General Explanation:**
       - Explain what Prefetch files are, how they are created, and their structure.
       - Discuss their storage location in the Windows system and the types of data they contain.
     - **Application to Investigation:**
       - Describe how you identified the relevant Prefetch files during your investigation of Jean's computer.
       - Provide specific examples, such as finding a Prefetch file that showed the execution of Microsoft Outlook, supporting your theory of email exfiltration.

   - **4.2. Forensic Value of Prefetch Files**
     - **General Explanation:**
       - Discuss how Prefetch files provide forensic investigators with details such as the last execution time, frequency of program use, and the path of executable files.
     - **Application to Investigation:**
       - Explain how Prefetch data was used to establish a timeline in your investigation, linking the use of certain applications (like Outlook) to the timeframes of interest.
       - Mention how this timeline helped corroborate or refute statements made by Jean or Alison during interviews.

   - **4.3. Tools and Techniques for Prefetch Analysis**
     - **General Explanation:**
       - Provide details about the tools used for Prefetch analysis, such as WinPrefetchView and PECmd.
       - Include a step-by-step guide on how to use one of these tools to extract and analyze Prefetch data.
     - **Application to Investigation:**
       - Discuss the specific tools you used during your investigation and how they helped extract critical Prefetch data.
       - Include an example of analyzing a Prefetch file for the Outlook application, showing how this confirmed Jean's use of the application around the time of the document exfiltration.

   - **4.4. Case Study or Practical Application**
     - **General Explanation:**
       - Discuss a hypothetical or real-world scenario where Prefetch analysis was crucial to solving a case.
     - **Application to Investigation:**
       - Present your investigation as a case study, where Prefetch analysis provided critical evidence linking Jean to the exfiltration of the m57biz.xls file.
       - Explain how the Prefetch data was used to establish Jean's activity on her computer, supporting the conclusions drawn in your final report.

#### 5. **Limitations (~300 words)**
   - **General Explanation:**
     - Discuss the limitations of Prefetch analysis, such as potential data deletion, limited retention period, or the impact of system settings.
   - **Application to Investigation:**
     - Reflect on any limitations you encountered during your investigation, such as missing Prefetch files due to system cleanup or limited retention of the files.
     - Suggest complementary artefacts (like ShimCache or Event Logs) that could be used alongside Prefetch data to strengthen forensic conclusions.

#### 6. **References**
   - List at least five (5) good research sources, including references to documentation, technical papers, and articles related to Prefetch analysis.
   - Use APA 6 / Chicago 16B referencing style.

#### 7. **Appendices (if necessary)**
   - Include any additional material, such as screenshots of Prefetch analysis or extended data tables, that support your report but would interrupt the flow of the main text.

### Conclusion:
By tying the Prefetch artefact to your recent investigation, you demonstrate the practical application of forensic techniques and how they directly contribute to solving real-world cases. This approach not only shows your technical knowledge but also your ability to apply forensic principles to real investigative scenarios.
