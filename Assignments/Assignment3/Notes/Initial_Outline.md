**Total Word Count**: ~2000 words

This outline ensures a balanced and concise exploration of Prefetch files, with each section directly supported by academic and practitioner sources from the RAG. By adhering to this structure, you'll provide a detailed yet focused analysis within the allotted word count.
#### 5. **Limitations (~300 words)**
   - **General Explanation:**
     - Discuss the limitations of Prefetch analysis, such as potential data deletion, limited retention period, or the impact of system settings.
   - **Application to Investigation:**
     - Reflect on any limitations you encountered during your investigation, such as missing Prefetch files due to system cleanup or limited retention of the files.
     - Suggest complementary artefacts (like ShimCache or Event Logs) that could be used alongside Prefetch data to strengthen forensic conclusions.

#### 6. **References**
   - List at least five (5) good research sources, including references to documentation, technical papers, and articles related to Prefetch analysis.
   - Use APA 6 / Chicago 16B referencing style.
