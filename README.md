# ZEIT8028 Digital Forensics

## Introduction

Welcome to the ZEIT8028 Digital Forensics course repository. This course, offered by UNSW Canberra, provides a comprehensive introduction to digital forensic analysis and investigation principles. Students will learn both theoretical concepts and practical techniques essential for conducting forensic investigations using contemporary open-source tools.

## Course Outline

The course is divided into five main modules, each focusing on different aspects of digital forensics:

1. **Module 1: The Forensic Method**
2. **Module 2: Disk Forensics**
3. **Module 3: Registry Forensics**
4. **Module 4: Network Forensics**
5. **Module 5: Memory Forensics**

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


### Descriptions of Each Directory and File

- **Evidence/**: Contains all the evidence collected during the investigation.
  - **disk_image/**: Directory to store disk images.
  - **screenshots/**: Directory to store screenshots of findings and steps.

- **Notes/**: Contains markdown files documenting the steps taken during the investigation.
  - **01_Initial_Setup.md**: Notes on the initial setup.
  - **02_Verification.md**: Notes on the verification process.
  - **03_Analysis.md**: Notes on the analysis of evidence.
  - **04_Findings.md**: Notes on the final findings of the investigation.

- **Reports/**: Contains the final report of the investigation.
  - **Final_Report.md**: The comprehensive final report of the investigation.

- **Scripts/**: Contains any scripts used during the investigation.
  - **analysis_scripts.py**: Python script for analyzing forensic data.

## Course Details & Outcomes

### Course Description

This course introduces participants to digital forensic analysis and investigation first principles. Students will learn theoretical concepts including the digital forensic method, and practical skills in analyzing file systems, memory, and operating system artifacts using contemporary open-source tools.

### Course Aims

Upon completion of this course, students will:

1. Understand how to professionally approach and conduct a digital forensic investigation.
2. Utilize contemporary open-source tools, techniques, and procedures for forensic analysis.
3. Derive and exploit the forensic value of operating system artifacts using first principles.
4. Perform a cyber-centric forensic investigation producing a succinct, accurate, and actionable intelligence product.

### Course Learning Outcomes

1. Understand how to professionally approach and conduct a digital forensic investigation, regardless of its size and complexity.
2. Demonstrate how to utilize contemporary open-source tools, techniques, and procedures to conduct forensic analysis.
3. Derive and exploit the forensic value of atomic operating system artifacts using first principles.
4. Perform a cyber-centric forensic investigation producing an intelligence product that is succinct, accurate, and actionable.
